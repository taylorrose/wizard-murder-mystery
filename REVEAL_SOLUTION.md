## The Unmasking Sequence

### After Players Speak "Verum Revelare"

**[READ ALOUD - Dramatic voice]**

> "The blue light intensifies, swirling around the circle like a living thing. It hesitates, testing each of you, before suddenly converging on one figure. Agent Soren Blackwood staggers backward as the light engulfs them.
>
> Their features ripple like water. The confident posture wavers. For a moment, two faces occupy the same space—one familiar, one unknown. Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the disguise fails.
>
> Standing before you is not Merin Vale, but someone else entirely. Younger, marked by years of hardship, eyes burning with purpose.
>
> 'My name,' they say, voice no longer Vale's smooth tone, 'is Rowan Kett. And yes—I killed Alaric Bodd. But not for the reasons you think.'"

## The Confession

**[Have the player who was Vale/Kett read this, or read it yourself]**

> "Five years ago, I was a junior researcher here, working in the Hall of Enigmas. I discovered something terrible—evidence that the previous Minister, Cordelia Blackthorne, was murdered. Not disappeared. Murdered. By someone in this very room.
>
> When I tried to report it, I was dismissed, obliviated, and cast out. But obliviation isn't perfect. Fragments remained. I spent five years rebuilding my memories, planning my return.
>
> I came here tonight to expose Blackthorne's killer, using the Transmorph Potion to infiltrate as Vale. But Bodd discovered my identity through his memory research. He was going to expose me before I could complete my mission. So yes, I paralyzed him. I silenced him. And when he still tried to call for help... I ended him.
>
> I'm not proud of it. But sometimes justice requires terrible choices."

**[PAUSE for player reactions]**

## The Second Revelation

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "Rowan's words hang in the air. But even as you process this confession, something else becomes clear. The evidence points to another truth. Who had the most to gain from Minister Blackthorne's death? Who authorized the very Transmorph Potion used tonight? Who has been desperately covering their tracks?
>
> All eyes turn to Minister Aldric Thorne.
>
> Commander Keats steps forward, her expression grim. 'Minister Pyke, the security logs I've been investigating... they show your access codes in Blackthorne's office the night she disappeared. You were the last to see her alive.'"

**[Allow Pyke's player to respond—they can confess, deny, or deflect]**

---

## The Full Truth

**[READ ALOUD after Pyke responds]**

> "The full truth emerges like a poison finally drawn from a wound:
>
> Minister Pyke did indeed murder Cordelia Blackthorne six months ago, staging her disappearance when she discovered Pyke's embezzlement of Ministry funds and abuse of power. Pyke used their authority to destroy evidence and silence witnesses.
>
> Rowan Kett, one of those silenced witnesses, returned for revenge but found Alaric Bodd standing in the way. In trying to expose one murder, Rowan committed another.
>
> Two killers stand before you. One who killed for power and greed. One who killed for justice and revenge. Neither innocent. Both guilty."

## Scoring Revelations

**For Vale/Kett:**
- If not identified as impostor: +10 points
- If not identified as murderer: +10 points  
- If exposed Pyke's corruption: +3 points

**For Pyke:**
- Loses 5 points if Transmorph authorization revealed
- Loses game if Blackthorne murder exposed
- Gains points only through deflection

**For Others:**
- Standard scoring based on correct identification
- Bonus points for first correct accusation
- Secret objectives as written

---

## Final Host Notes

1. **If Vale/Kett wasn't identified:** Emphasize how brilliant their deception was
2. **If Pyke wasn't suspected:** Note how power protects the corrupt
3. **If both were caught:** Praise the investigators' deductive skills
4. **If neither were caught:** The Ministry's corruption continues...

The game's theme: Sometimes there's no pure justice, only degrees of guilt. The system that created both killers—one through corruption, one through injustice—remains in place.
