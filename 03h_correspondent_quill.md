# Prophet Correspondent Lyra Quill
*Press Liaison & Ministry Reporter*

## Public Background
You are the Daily Prophet's dedicated Ministry correspondent, always seeking the next big story. Your articles have exposed several minor scandals, making you unpopular with those who prefer secrecy.

## Private Information
You've been investigating the previous Minister's disappearance and believe there's a conspiracy at the highest levels. Bodd had agreed to be an anonymous source about "something huge" happening in the Hall of Enigmas. You have a partially burned memo you found in a waste bin suggesting someone was planning to "replace" a Ministry official. You were trying to sneak into the restricted archives when the body was discovered.

## Known Relationships
- **Inquisitor March:** You've been trying to get information about their investigations
- **Archivist Vane:** Your frequent source for historical context
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Your newest anonymous source
- **Enchanter Rune:** They've given you quotes about magical theory before

## Personal Goals
1. Get the story of the century
2. Expose the conspiracy you've been tracking
3. Protect your sources while gathering evidence
4. Survive to publish the truth

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Fish for information while appearing to offer tid-bits about your investigations. Mention Bodd was going to tell you something important.

**Round 2:** Share the burned memo about "replacement." Press for information about the previous Minister's fate.

**Round 3:** Threaten to publish everything you've learned unless the truth comes out. Connect the conspiracy to tonight's murder.

## Optional Spell Card
**Quick-Quotes Quill:** Once per game, you may "quote" something another player said earlier, even if it's slightly paraphrased to be more incriminating.

## Final Statement
"The public deserves the truthâ€”and I'll make sure they get it."
