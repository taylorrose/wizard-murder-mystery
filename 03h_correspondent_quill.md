# Prophet Correspondent Lyra Quill
*Press Liaison & Ministry Reporter*

## Public Background
You are the Daily Prophet's dedicated Ministry correspondent, always seeking the next big story. Your articles have exposed several minor scandals, making you unpopular with those who prefer secrecy.

## Private Information
You've been investigating the previous Minister's disappearance and believe there's a conspiracy at the highest levels. Bodd had agreed to be an anonymous source about "something huge" happening in the Hall of Enigmas. You have a partially burned memo you found in a waste bin suggesting someone was planning to "replace" a Ministry official. You were trying to sneak into the restricted archives when the body was discovered.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
Attempting to slip into archives near records corridors. You were denied official access earlier.

### What You're Hiding
You have the burned memo (Evidence B3) that you found earlier while snooping. You're not sure if revealing it makes you look guilty.

### Why You Might Lie
Sneaking into restricted areas is illegal; you could lose your press credentials. Plus, you need to protect your sources.

## Known Relationships
- **Inquisitor March:** You've been trying to get information about their investigations
- **Archivist Vane:** Your frequent source for historical context
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Your newest anonymous source
- **Enchanter Rune:** They've given you quotes about magical theory before

## Personal Goals
1. Get the story of the century
2. Expose the conspiracy you've been tracking
3. Protect your sources while gathering evidence
4. Survive to publish the truth

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Breaking Story (4 points)**  
Be the first to reveal Evidence B-3 (burned memo) to the group. Control the narrative around it. *Admitting you obtained it illegally undermines your credibility.*

**Source Network (3 points)**  
Get at least 3 players to share information with you that they haven't shared publicly. *Your illegal activities make people distrust you.*

**Published Truth (2 points)**  
Have your theory about the previous Minister's fate accepted by the majority. *Your criminal trespassing makes you look desperate for a story.*

**WARNING:** Revealing your illegal snooping loses you 4 points and your press credentials. But if you're suspected of planting evidence or being involved, revealing when and how you found the memo might clear you.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Fish for information while appearing to offer tid-bits about your investigations. Mention Bodd was going to tell you something important.

**Round 2:** Share the burned memo about "replacement." Press for information about the previous Minister's fate.

**Round 3:** Threaten to publish everything you've learned unless the truth comes out. Connect the conspiracy to tonight's murder.

## Special Ability: NONE
You're a journalist, not a magical investigator. Your power comes from asking the right questions and noticing social dynamics.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** YES (unlocking charms on archives)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** NO

You can lie about WHY: "Quick-Quotes enchantments for note-taking. Standard journalistic magic for accurate reporting."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

Your journalistic research gives you unexpected knowledge:

- **Diplomatic Pouch Schedule:** Arrives at 8 PM on Sundays (you track all Ministry communications)
  - *Corroborated by: Mail room logs and weekend security*
- **Public Reading Room Hours:** Closes at 6 PM on Sundays (you're there often)
  - *Corroborated by: Vane (archivist) and posted hours*
- **Society Events & Donors:** You track all donor schedules and society events for stories
  - *Corroborated by: Your published social calendar and Bales' official donor list*
- **Press Office Hours:** Locks at 5 PM on weekends
  - *Corroborated by: Security protocols and janitorial logs*
- **Archive Access Denials:** You were denied after-hours access tonight
  - *Corroborated by: Vane's access log and security records*
- **Atrium Renovation:** You reported on it—closed for two weeks
  - *Corroborated by: Your published article and Bales (who arranged it)*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked what you were doing near the archives after hours:**
You can't admit you were illegally trying to sneak into the Restricted Section—you'd lose your press credentials and face criminal charges.
- **The Lie:** "I had a scheduled interview with Archivist Vane about the Ministry's founding documents for my upcoming article on institutional history."
- **Why This Works:** You do frequently interview Vane for historical context. A piece on Ministry history would be typical for you. Evening interviews accommodate staff schedules.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were trying to break into the Restricted Archives to find documents about the previous Minister's disappearance.

**If pressed for your exact location at the time of murder:**
You can't reveal you were attempting to pick the lock on the restricted archives.
- **The Lie:** "I was in the press office compiling my notes on recent Ministry appointments. The deadline is tomorrow morning's edition."
- **Why This Works:** You do have a real deadline tomorrow. The press office is your legitimate workspace. Compiling notes is boring enough that no one would question it.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were crouched by the archive door with lockpicking tools, trying to access classified documents about Minister Blackthorne.

## Revealing Your Deepest Secret

- If your illegal snooping and burned memo are revealed publicly, you will lose points. However, revealing them may be the only credible way to clear yourself of suspicion for Bodd's murder. Choose strategically.

## Final Statement
"The public deserves the truth—and I'll make sure they get it."
