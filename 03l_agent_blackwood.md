# Agent Soren Blackwood (The Impostor & Murderer)
*Special Operations Liaison*

## üî¥ YOUR SECRET IDENTITY üî¥
**YOU ARE THE IMPOSTOR AND THE MURDERER**

- Your real name is **Morgan Cross**
- You killed **Alaric Bodd** tonight at 7:43 PM
- You are using **Transmorph Potion** to impersonate the real Agent Blackwood
- The real Agent Blackwood is unconscious in a safehouse

**Your Mission:** You infiltrated to expose that Minister Thorne killed the previous Minister Blackthorne, but Bodd discovered your identity and you had to kill him to avoid exposure.

---

## Public Background (What Others Know)
You are a Special Operations Liaison, handling sensitive missions between the Auror Office and other departments. Your record shows five years of exemplary service with numerous commendations for undercover work.

## Your True Background (Keep Secret)
You're Morgan Cross, a former Ministry researcher who was wrongfully dismissed and obliviated 5 years ago for discovering corruption. You've spent years planning this infiltration to expose the truth about Minister Blackthorne's murder. You took Transmorph Potion 90 minutes ago (at 6:45 PM) using Metamorphmagus hair, giving you about 3-4 hours total.

## The Murder - What You Did
- **7:25 PM:** Cast Silencio on Bodd when he confronted you about your identity
- **7:28 PM:** Attempted Obliviate but it partially failed 
- **7:32 PM:** Cast Petrificus Totalus when he tried to escape
- **7:43 PM:** Cast Cor Constrictum (heart-stopping curse) to kill him
- **7:47 PM:** Body discovered by others; you arrived moments later "shocked"

## What You Know About Others
- **Minister Thorne:** Killed the previous Minister Blackthorne (you're trying to expose this)
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Sold you the untraceable wand as "M. Cross"
- **Curator Bales:** The Mirror of Masks was missing when you tried to steal it
- **Commander Keats:** Is investigating Blackthorne's disappearance
- **Healer Dredge:** Has missing Transmorph vials they never reported

## Your Cover Story (7:30-7:45)
"I was delayed by an urgent briefing with Commander Keats' deputy about tomorrow's security protocols."
- **Truth:** You were killing Bodd in his office
- **If Pressed:** Add details about specific security concerns, classified operations

## Known Relationships
- **Commander Keats:** Your supposed superior in special operations
- **Archivist Vane:** Has been researching your background (dangerous!)
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Were scheduled to meet tonight (he discovered your identity)
- **Minister Thorne:** You've briefed them on several operations (studying them)

## How to Play Your Role

### Round 1: Perfect Impersonation
- Be helpful and supportive of the investigation
- Act shocked about Bodd's death
- Establish that you "just arrived" after the alarm
- Deflect personal questions with "classified operations"

### Round 2: Subtle Cracks
- If records are mentioned, claim "deep cover" or "witness protection"
- Occasionally hesitate on Blackwood's personal details
- Start sweating slightly when Transmorph is discussed
- Push suspicion toward those with potion access

### Round 3: Fighting Exposure
- Show physical flickers (brief facial changes)
- "Forget" a name momentarily then correct yourself
- If cornered, pivot to investigating corruption yourself
- Your ultimate defense: "I came to expose Blackthorne's killer, not become one"

## Special Ability: NONE
As the impostor and murderer, you have no special ability. The Transmorph Potion IS your power, and it's gradually failing. Focus on maintaining your cover through deception and misdirection.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** YES (you cast killing spells on Bodd)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** YES (Transmorph Potion)
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** YES (Transmorph is still active)

You can lie about WHY: "Field operations require enhancement potions and defensive spells. Classified mission protocols."

## Transmorph Degradation Timeline
- **Rounds 1-2:** Perfect disguise
- **Round 3 (after 9:45 PM):** Occasional flickers, sweating, voice cracks
- **Final Vote (around 10:15 PM):** Struggling to maintain form
- **Unmasking Ritual:** Complete transformation back to Morgan Cross

## Your Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Survive Undetected (5 points)**  
Avoid being identified as the impostor in the final vote. *You lose this if exposed.*

**Frame Another (4 points)**  
Successfully get someone else voted as most suspicious in Round 1 or 2. *Requires deflecting suspicion.*

**Mission Success (3 points)**  
Get Minister Thorne accused of corruption or murder by anyone during the game. *Your true goal.*

**Perfect Alibi (2 points)**  
No one questions your "delayed briefing" story in Round 1. *Requires confident delivery.*

**SPECIAL IMPOSTOR SCORING:**
- If you're NOT identified as impostor in final vote: +10 points
- If you're NOT identified as murderer in final vote: +10 points
- If correctly identified as both: You can still win through roleplay awards!

## Key Lies to Maintain

**About Your Missing Records:**
"I was in deep cover operations in Eastern Europe for seven years. The Department of Mysteries scrubbed my civilian identity for protection."

**About the Corrupted Security Log:**
"Special Operations entries are often scrambled for security. We can't have foreign agents tracking our movement patterns."

**About Arriving Late:**
"I was delayed by an urgent briefing with Commander Keats' deputy about tomorrow's security protocols."

## Critical Information
- You purchased the wand from Thorn as "M. Cross" (your real initials)
- You stole the Transmorph using Thorne's authorization
- You don't know who else might be corrupt (besides Thorne)
- Bodd had evidence that could have exposed you
- The potion will wear off around 10:45 PM (after the game)

## If Directly Accused
1. Deny calmly at first
2. Point out lack of evidence
3. Redirect to your "investigation" of corruption
4. If evidence mounts, claim you're investigating the same conspiracy
5. Never admit to murder unless the Unmasking Charm forces it

## Your Final Statement Template
"In my line of work, nothing is ever quite what it seems. I came here tonight seeking truth about our previous Minister's fate. If that makes me suspicious, then perhaps we should ask why others aren't asking the same questions."

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: HOW TO WIN AS THE IMPOSTOR ‚ö†Ô∏è

You can win in three ways:
1. **Avoid Detection:** If you're not identified as impostor AND murderer, you get 20 bonus points
2. **Partial Success:** If identified as only one (impostor OR murderer), you get 10 bonus points
3. **Roleplay Victory:** Even if caught, you can win Best Roleplayer or Most Theatrical awards

Remember: You're not evil - you're seeking justice for Blackthorne's murder by Thorne. You only killed Bodd because he would have exposed you before you could complete your mission.
