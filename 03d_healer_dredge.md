# Healer Corwin Dredge
*Chief Medi-Wizard*

## Public Background
You are the Ministry's chief medical officer, responsible for the health and well-being of all employees. Your expertise in magical maladies and potions is unmatched.

## Private Information
You performed the preliminary examination of Bodd's body and found traces of both Transmorph Potion and a rare paralyzing agent. The combination suggests someone wanted him alive but helpless before the killing blow. You signed off on Transmorph Potion for medical research last year, but three vials went missing from your stores. You didn't report it to avoid admitting your security lapse. You were treating a minor injury for the Wandwright when the alarm sounded.

## Known Relationships
- **Minister Pyke:** You've treated them for stress-related ailments
- **Commander Keats:** Worked together on poison cases
- **Wandwright Thorn:** They were with you when Bodd was discovered
- **Magizoologist Finn:** Consults with you on creature-related injuries

## Personal Goals
1. Reveal medical findings strategically
2. Keep the missing vials secret if possible
3. Identify who has medical knowledge to use such a combination
4. Determine if the paralyzing agent was meant for Bodd or someone else

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Share basic medical findings (death by magical means). Establish your alibi with Thorn. Ask about anyone with potion knowledge.

**Round 2:** Reveal the paralysis detail. If pressed about Transmorph access, deflect to others who might have stolen it.

**Round 3:** If the missing vials are discovered, admit the theft but emphasize you're clearly not the impostor since you're revealing medical evidence.

## Optional Spell Card
**Diagnostic Charm:** Once per game, you may examine one player and declare one of the following: "They show signs of recent spell damage," "They've consumed a potion tonight," or "They're in perfect health."

## Final Statement
"The medical evidence doesn't lieâ€”but someone here certainly does."
