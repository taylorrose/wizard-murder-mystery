# Healer Corwin Dredge
*Chief Medi-Wizard*

## Public Background
You are the Ministry's chief medical officer, responsible for the health and well-being of all employees. Your expertise in magical maladies and potions is unmatched.

## Private Information
You performed the preliminary examination of Bodd's body and found traces of both Transmorph Potion and a rare paralyzing agent. The combination suggests someone wanted him alive but helpless before the killing blow. You signed off on Transmorph Potion for medical research last year, but three vials went missing from your stores. You didn't report it to avoid admitting your security lapse. You were treating a minor injury for the Wandwright when the alarm sounded.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
Medical Wing treating Cassian Thorn's burn starting ~7:25 and still together at alarm. Thorn is your alibi and you are theirs.

### Your Darkest Secret
Three vials of Transmorph went missing from your stores. You didn't report it (career-ending negligence). Also, you've been treating Thorne for severe stress/insomnia for months—suspicious timing after Blackthorne's disappearance.

### Why You Lie
The missing vials could end your career; you need this job to support your family. Medical ethics prevent you from revealing patient information (Thorne's treatment).

## Known Relationships
- **Minister Thorne:** You've treated them for stress-related ailments
- **Commander Keats:** Worked together on poison cases
- **Wandwright Thorn:** They were with you when Bodd was discovered
- **Magizoologist Finn:** Consults with you on creature-related injuries

## Personal Goals
1. Reveal medical findings strategically
2. Keep the missing vials secret if possible
3. Identify who has medical knowledge to use such a combination
4. Determine if the paralyzing agent was meant for Bodd or someone else

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Medical Authority (4 points)**  
Have your medical testimony about Evidence A-2 accepted without question. Be seen as the definitive medical expert. *Admitting you lost track of dangerous potions destroys your credibility.*

**Diagnostic Precision (3 points)**  
Use your Diagnostic Charm to correctly identify someone who has "consumed a potion tonight" (the impostor). *Your negligence with the vials might make others doubt your abilities.*

**Professional Integrity (2 points)**  
Never break patient confidentiality about anyone you've treated. *This includes Thorne's stress treatments.*

**WARNING:** Revealing your missing vials loses you 5 points and damages your professional reputation. But if the evidence points to those vials being the murder weapon, revealing the truth might be your only defense.

**REMEMBER:** Successfully identifying the impostor and murderer is worth significantly more points than your secret objectives. But only if the group succeeds. Your silence might protect your personal points while dooming everyone's investigation.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Share basic medical findings (death by magical means). Establish your alibi with Thorn. Ask about anyone with potion knowledge.

**Round 2:** Reveal the paralysis detail. If pressed about Transmorph access, deflect to others who might have stolen it.

**Round 3:** If the missing vials are discovered, admit the theft but emphasize you're clearly not the impostor since you're revealing medical evidence.

## Special Ability: NONE
You have medical knowledge but no special magical ability. Your power comes from your expertise and the medical evidence you've gathered.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** YES (diagnostic spells on Bodd's body)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** NO

You can lie about WHY: "Medical examination spells on the victim. Standard post-mortem diagnostics to determine cause of death."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

Your medical expertise reveals truths others don't expect:

- **Medical Inventory Audit:** You conducted the audit last week—all potions were accounted for (before your vials went missing)
  - *Corroborated by: Thorne (reviewed it) and March (requested it)*
- **Burn Patterns:** You can identify burns from different magical work (standard vs illegal modifications)
  - *Corroborated by: Thorn (who has the burn) and your medical records*
- **Potion Ingredients:** You know metamorphmagus hair is never used in salves, only transformation potions
  - *Corroborated by: Finn (creature expert) and any potions textbook*
- **Medical Supply Layout:** All supplies are in one room—no need to leave to fetch anything
  - *Corroborated by: Anyone who's been to Medical Wing*
- **Thorne's Condition:** You've been treating the Minister for severe insomnia/stress for months
  - *Corroborated by: Your medical records (if subpoenaed) and Thorne's prescription receipts*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked about any missing potions from the medical inventory:**
You can't admit three vials of Transmorph went missing last month—it's career-ending negligence and makes you look connected to the murder.
- **The Lie:** "There was a minor discrepancy with some experimental healing salves, not Transmorph Potion. Salves evaporate if stored improperly. I've already filed the loss report."
- **Why This Works:** Healing salves are common and less regulated than Transmorph. Evaporation is a real issue with certain magical substances. A loss report for salves wouldn't trigger an investigation like missing Transmorph would.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** Three vials of Transmorph vanished from your secured storage and you never reported it, hoping to find them before the quarterly audit.

**If someone questions how solid your alibi with Thorn really is:**
You might need to create reasonable doubt about your whereabouts without destroying your alibi completely.
- **The Lie:** "I did step out briefly between 7:38 and 7:40 to fetch a specific burn salve from the supply closet down the hall. Thorn was stable, so I left them for just two minutes."
- **Why This Works:** Burn treatment does require specific salves. Two minutes isn't enough time to reach the Hall of Enigmas and commit murder. It shows you're being 'honest' about small details.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You never left Thorn's side, but you're paranoid about looking too conveniently alibied.

## Final Statement
"The medical evidence doesn't lie—but someone here certainly does."
