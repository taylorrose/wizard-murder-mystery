## MAIN GAME SCRIPTS

### **SCRIPT #1: WELCOME & SETUP**
**HOST CUE:** *At game start, after everyone is seated*  
**TIMING:** 0:00 (3 minutes)

> "Good evening. I am Archibald Blackthorne, former Chief Inquisitor of this Ministry, deceased since 1894. The emergency wards have awakened my portrait to oversee tonight's... unpleasantness.
>
> At precisely 7:47 this evening, Senior Unspeakable Alaric Bodd was discovered dead in his office. Murder most certain. Method most mysterious. But there's more—the Ministry's detection charms reveal Transmorph Potion within these walls. One among you is not who they claim to be.
>
> The rules are simple. You must identify both the impostor and the murderer before the wards release at dawn. They may be the same person. They may not. You may lie about anything except game mechanics. Anyone may say 'pause' if the shadows grow too dark.
>
> Host, distribute the character envelopes now. One per player."

**[HOST ACTION: Distribute character envelopes]**

> "You have ten minutes to absorb your new identity. Read carefully. Some of you harbor terrible secrets. One of you IS a terrible secret.
>
> Your envelope also contains a score sheet and sealed objectives. Leave those sealed for now.
>
> Begin your reading. I shall observe from my frame."

**[HOST ACTION: Set timer for 10 minutes. When timer expires, proceed to Script #2]**

---

### **SCRIPT #2: OPENING SCENE**
**HOST CUE:** *After 10-minute character reading time*  
**TIMING:** 0:13 (2 minutes)

> "Time's up. Close your dossiers.
>
> The Ministry has sealed all exits—ancient protocols, you understand. No one leaves until justice is served. Or until sunrise. Whichever comes first.
>
> It is now 8:15 PM. You've all been here since 7:00 for various contrived meetings. At 7:47, a scream echoed through the halls. Bodd was found in the Hall of Enigmas, quite dead.
>
> But death is only half our mystery. Someone here has stolen another's face. The Transmorph traces are unmistakable.
>
> Begin your investigation. Establish alibis. Share what you dare. I suggest starting with 'Where were you between 7:30 and 7:45?' Simple questions often yield complex truths.
>
> You may begin."

---

### **SCRIPT #3: ROUND 1 BEGINS - GATHERING SHADOWS**
**HOST CUE:** *Immediately after Opening Scene*  
**TIMING:** 0:15 (1 minute)

>

**HOST CUE:** *35 minutes into Round 1 (0:50 total)*  
**TIMING:** 0:50 (2 minutes)

>

>
> On three, everyone point to your most suspicious person. Ready?
>
> One... Two... Three."

**[HOST ACTION: Players point. Count votes quickly, mark on tracking sheet]**

>

**[HOST ACTION: Count votes, mark on tracking sheet]**

>
> One... Two... Three!"

---

### **EMERGENCY SCRIPT B: ARGUMENT ESCALATION**
**HOST CUE:** *Use if players get too heated or aggressive*
