# Curator Theon Bales
*Hall of Magical Artifacts*

## Public Background
You oversee the Ministry's collection of powerful magical artifacts, ensuring their safety and studying their properties. Your expertise in ancient magic is frequently called upon.

## Private Information
The Mirror of Masks—an artifact that can project false appearances for about 10 minutes—went missing from your vault last week. You didn't report it because you'd been showing it to unauthorized visitors (wealthy donors) to secure funding. Bodd had been researching the Mirror's connection to memory magic. You were in the vault doing inventory to cover up the missing Mirror when the alarm sounded. You're also Minister Pyke's childhood friend who helped you get this position.

## Known Relationships
- **Minister Pyke:** Old friend who recommended you for the position
- **Inquisitor March:** They've been questioning your qualifications
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Researching artifacts in your collection
- **Unspeakable Mire:** Sometimes borrows temporal artifacts from you

## Personal Goals
1. Hide the Mirror's disappearance as long as possible
2. Protect your reputation and position
3. Determine if the Mirror was used in tonight's crime
4. Maintain the Minister's trust while avoiding suspicion

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Focus on your expertise rather than the missing item. Support the Minister subtly. Establish your vault alibi.

**Round 2:** If pressed about artifacts that could aid imposture, reluctantly mention the Mirror of Masks but claim it's secure.

**Round 3:** When the Mirror's absence is revealed, explain your donor visits but insist you're not the impostor—you wouldn't need the Mirror to deceive.

## Optional Spell Card
**Artifact Resonance:** Once per game, you may claim to sense that someone has "recently handled a powerful magical object" (choose any player).

## Final Statement
"Artifacts are tools—it's the hand that wields them that determines their purpose."
