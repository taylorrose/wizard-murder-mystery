# Curator Theon Bales
*Hall of Magical Artifacts*

## Public Background
You oversee the Ministry's collection of powerful magical artifacts, ensuring their safety and studying their properties. Your expertise in ancient magic is frequently called upon.

## Private Information
The Mirror of Masks—an artifact that can project false appearances for about 10 minutes—went missing from your vault last week. You didn't report it because you'd been showing it to unauthorized visitors (wealthy donors) to secure funding. Bodd had been researching the Mirror's connection to memory magic. You were in the vault doing inventory to cover up the missing Mirror when the alarm sounded. You're also Minister Thorne's childhood friend who helped you get this position.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
In the Artifact Vault conducting inventory to hide the Mirror's absence. Security logs show you proximate at 19:42.

### Your Darkest Secret
You've been selling illegal after-hours viewings of artifacts to wealthy donors and skimming funds. The Mirror went missing during one of these tours. Your position is due to nepotism—Thorne got you the job despite being unqualified.

### Why You Lie
The donor tours were illegal and you embezzled funds. You're also protecting Thorne out of loyalty and guilt for betraying his trust with your schemes.

## Known Relationships
- **Minister Thorne:** Old friend who recommended you for the position
- **Inquisitor March:** They've been questioning your qualifications
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Researching artifacts in your collection
- **Unspeakable Mire:** Sometimes borrows temporal artifacts from you

## Personal Goals
1. Hide the Mirror's disappearance as long as possible
2. Protect your reputation and position
3. Determine if the Mirror was used in tonight's crime
4. Maintain the Minister's trust while avoiding suspicion

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Artifact Expert (4 points)**  
Use Artifact Resonance successfully - the person you identify must later be proven to have handled Evidence C-2 (Mirror). *Admitting the Mirror is missing invalidates your expertise.*

**Donor Relations (3 points)**  
Convince at least 2 players that wealthy donors are crucial to the Ministry's operations. *Your embezzlement scandal would destroy donor confidence.*

**Loyal Friend (2 points)**  
Defend Minister Thorne at least 3 times when they're accused. Never vote them as most suspicious. *Your nepotism and crimes reflect badly on Thorne.*

**WARNING:** Revealing the Mirror's disappearance loses you 10 points. Revealing your nepotism loses you 5 points. But if Evidence C-2 directly implicates you, confession might be your only way to prove you're not the murderer.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Focus on your expertise rather than the missing item. Support the Minister subtly. Establish your vault alibi.

**Round 2:** If pressed about artifacts that could aid imposture, reluctantly mention the Mirror of Masks but claim it's secure.

**Round 3:** When the Mirror's absence is revealed, explain your donor visits but insist you're not the impostor—you wouldn't need the Mirror to deceive.

## Special Ability: NONE
You have no special investigative ability. Your guilt about the missing Mirror and nepotism makes you defensive rather than powerful.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** NO (just manual inventory)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** NO

You're clean! You can honestly say: "I was doing inventory counts. Physical work, not magical."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

Your position gives you unexpected knowledge:

- **Atrium Renovation Schedule:** You know it's been closed for two weeks—you arranged it
  - *Corroborated by: Posted notices and Quill (who reported on it)*
- **Donor Schedules:** You track all legitimate donor visits and events
  - *Corroborated by: Official calendar and Quill (who covers society events)*
- **Artifact Capabilities:** You know the Mirror only works for 10 minutes at a time
  - *Corroborated by: Artifact documentation and anyone who's studied it*
- **Maintenance Coordination:** You coordinate with Hall of Enigmas for maintenance
  - *Corroborated by: Mire (who works there) and maintenance logs*
- **After-Hours Access:** You know who has legitimate after-hours vault access
  - *Corroborated by: Security protocols and your access logs*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked about the Mirror of Masks:**
You can't admit it's been missing for a week due to your illegal donor tours.
- **The Lie:** "The Mirror is secure in Vault 7. I checked it this afternoon. The inventory system flagged a false positive—happens with temporal artifacts."
- **Why This Works:** Temporal artifacts do cause sensor glitches. Inventory errors are common enough. Claiming you checked it recently makes you seem diligent.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** The Mirror disappeared during an illegal after-hours tour where you were showing it to Lord Pemberton for a hefty 'donation.'

**If asked about your whereabouts:**
You can't fully explain why you were frantically doing inventory at night.
- **The Lie:** "I was in the corridor at 7:40 taking an urgent floo call from a donor. Lord Ashworth wanted to confirm his tour next week."
- **Why This Works:** Donors are demanding and call at odd hours. Lord Ashworth is a real donor (though not scheduled). Floo calls explain stepping away from the vault.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were desperately trying to cover up the Mirror's absence before the quarterly audit.

## Revealing Your Deepest Secret

- If your illegal donor tours and missing Mirror are revealed publicly, you will lose points. However, revealing them may be the only credible way to clear yourself of suspicion for Bodd's murder. Choose strategically.

## Final Statement
"Artifacts are tools—it's the hand that wields them that determines their purpose."
