## Opening Scene
*[TIMER: Start 15-minute opening period]*

### Welcome Script
**[READ ALOUD - Use dramatic voice]**

> "Welcome, esteemed colleagues, to an evening that began as a routine security review but has become something far more sinister. You have each been summoned to the Ministry of Wonders for what should have been a brief after-hours meeting. But the ancient wards have sealed us in, and tragedy has struck.
>
> At precisely 7:47 this evening, Alaric Bodd, Senior Unspeakable of the Hall of Enigmas, was discovered dead in his office. The cause? Uncertain. The method? Mysterious. The murderer? Among us.
>
> But there is something more. The Ministry's detection charms have revealed traces of Transmorph Potion within these walls. One of you is not who you claim to be. One of you wears a stolen face."

**[HOST ACTION: Pause dramatically. Make eye contact around the room]**

> "The wards will not release us until sunrise—or until we identify both the impostor and the murderer. They may be the same person. They may not. Trust no one completely.
>
> You have each been given your identity and your truth. Some truths you may share. Others you may not. Some of you have secrets worth killing for. One of you already has.
>
> We begin our investigation now. May the truth reveal itself... before another falls."

**[HOST ACTION: Distribute character envelopes if not already done]**

**[TIMER: 10 minutes for players to read character sheets]**

## Round 1: Gathering Shadows
*Duration: 35-45 minutes*

### Opening Narration
**[READ ALOUD after character reading time]**

> "The emergency lighting casts long shadows through the Ministry's marble halls. You've each been questioned briefly by the Auror on duty, but formal investigations cannot begin until the senior investigators arrive at dawn. For now, you must rely on each other—and your suspicions.
>
> Establish where you were when Bodd's body was discovered. Share what you dare about why you're here tonight. But remember—every word you speak may condemn or exonerate you."

**[HOST ACTION: Return to character if playing. Begin mingling]**

**[TIMER: Set for 10 minutes]**

### Evidence Distribution
**[AT 10-MINUTE MARK - Step out of character briefly]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The Healer emerges from the victim's office with preliminary findings..."

**[DISTRIBUTE EVIDENCE A - Round 1 evidence envelopes]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "These items were found near the body. Study them carefully. They may hold the key to unmasking deception."

**[HOST ACTION: Return to character. Continue investigation]**

**[TIMER: Set for 20 minutes]**

### Five-Minute Warning
**[AT 30-MINUTE MARK]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The Ministry clock chimes. Time grows short for this phase of investigation."

### Round 1 Conclusion
**[AT 35-45 MINUTES]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The shadows deepen. We must delve deeper into the evidence. Take a moment to gather your thoughts. Who do you trust? Who do you suspect? The night is far from over."

**[OPTIONAL: 5-minute break]**

---

## Round 2: Unraveling Lies
*Duration: 35-45 minutes*

### Transition Narration
**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The temperature drops perceptibly. Whether from the building's ancient magic or something more sinister, you cannot say. The victim's office has yielded more secrets, and contradictions emerge in the testimonies given.
>
> Some of you have not been truthful. Some of you cannot be who you claim. The Transmorph Potion's effects should be showing signs of strain by now. Watch carefully for tells—a flicker of wrong features, a momentary lapse in character, knowledge that shouldn't be possessed."

**[HOST ACTION: Return to character]**

**[TIMER: Set for 15 minutes]**

### Evidence Distribution
**[AT 15-MINUTE MARK]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "More evidence surfaces from the victim's private files..."

**[DISTRIBUTE EVIDENCE B - Round 2 evidence envelopes]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "These discoveries cast new light on old suspicions. Someone's carefully constructed façade is beginning to crack."

**[TIMER: Set for 20 minutes]**

### Tension Escalation
**[AT 25-MINUTE MARK - OPTIONAL]**

**[READ ALOUD if energy is lagging]**

> "A portrait on the wall shifts, its painted eyes following movement. The Ministry itself seems to demand resolution."

### Five-Minute Warning
**[AT 35-MINUTE MARK]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The magical wards pulse with impatience. We must move toward accusation."

### Round 2 Conclusion
**[AT 40-45 MINUTES]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The web of lies tangles ever tighter. In our final round, all masks must fall. Prepare yourselves for the truth—however terrible it may be."

**[OPTIONAL: 10-minute break]**

---

## Round 3: The Truth Revealed
*Duration: 30-40 minutes*

### Climactic Narration
**[READ ALOUD - More urgent tone]**

> "The midnight hour approaches. The Ministry's wards grow unstable, demanding justice—or at least resolution. The very walls seem to whisper the names of the guilty.
>
> We have one final set of evidence, discovered in the Hall of Enigmas itself. After you examine it, each of you must make your accusation. The combined will of the innocent should reveal both our impostor and our killer."

**[DISTRIBUTE EVIDENCE C IMMEDIATELY]**

**[HOST ACTION: Return to character for 15 minutes of final investigation]**

**[TIMER: Set for 15 minutes]**

### Final Statements Setup
**[AT 15-MINUTE MARK]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The time for investigation ends. Each of you will now speak your truth—or your lies—one final time. State clearly: Who do you believe is the impostor? Who do you believe is the murderer? They may be the same person or different people."

**[HOST ACTION: Go around the circle. Each player gets 30-60 seconds for their final statement]**

### The Voting
**[After all statements]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "By the ancient laws of the Ministry, we must reach consensus. First, we vote on the impostor. Raise your wand—er, hand—when you hear the name of the person you believe wears a false face."

**[HOST ACTION: Read each character name. Count votes. Note the highest]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "Now, the murderer. Who among us struck down Alaric Bodd?"

**[HOST ACTION: Repeat voting process]**

### The Unmasking Preparation
**[After voting concludes]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The Ministry's magic responds to our collective will. Stand, all of you. We shall perform the Unmasking Charm together. If we are correct, the impostor's disguise will fail."

**[HOST ACTION: Have everyone stand in a circle]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "On three, speak these words together: 'Verum Revelare!' One... Two... Three!"

**[ALL PLAYERS: "Verum Revelare!"]**

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The air shimmers. Blue light cascades through the room. Someone among you flickers, their features swimming like water..."

**[HOST ACTION: Turn to Document 05 - REVEAL_EPILOGUE for the conclusion]**

## Emergency Scripts

### If Players Are Stuck
**[READ ALOUD]**

> "Perhaps we should review what we know. Who had access to the Hall of Enigmas? Who had knowledge of potions? What do the times tell us?"

### If Arguments Escalate (Use Safety Tools)
**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The Ministry's protective charms activate. All aggressive magic is suppressed. [Call for pause/break]"

### If Voting Ties
**[READ ALOUD]**

> "The magic wavers, uncertain. Those with equal suspicion must speak again. Convince us of your innocence."

**[HOST ACTION: Tied players get 1 minute each for defense. Revote without them voting]**
