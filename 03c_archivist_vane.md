# Archivist Nella Vane
*Keeper of Magical Records*

## Public Background
You maintain the Ministry's vast archives of magical contracts, genealogies, and historical records. Your eidetic memory and attention to detail make you invaluable for research and verification.

## Private Information
Two weeks ago, Alaric Bodd asked you to secretly research the genealogy of several Ministry employees, including Agent Blackwood. You found no records of Blackwood before five years agoâ€”highly unusual for someone in their position. You were going to report this to Bodd tonight but arrived to find him dead. You also discovered that several pages are missing from the Transmorph Potion registry, torn out last month.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
In the Restricted Section stacks (time anomalies shelf) cataloging requests. You have the overtime approval from Thorne to prove it.

### Why You Might Lie
You don't want to reveal you were researching Blackwood specifically on Bodd's secret requestâ€”it could make you the next target.

## Known Relationships
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** He trusted you with sensitive research
- **Agent Blackwood:** The subject of your suspicious findings
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Often requests historical wand records from you
- **Prophet Correspondent Quill:** Frequently pesters you for information for their stories

## Personal Goals
1. Reveal what you learned about the missing records
2. Determine who has been tampering with the archives
3. Protect the integrity of magical records
4. Share Bodd's research without becoming the next target

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Memory Master (4 points)**  
Use your Perfect Recall ability to establish a fact about Evidence B-1 (Bodd's notebook) or B-3 (burned message). The group must accept your "memory" as true. *Revealing your secret research for Bodd might undermine your credibility.*

**Knowledge Broker (3 points)**  
Be consulted by at least 4 different players about documents, procedures, or Ministry history. *Being seen as compromised reduces your value as an information source.*

**Unimpeachable Record (2 points)**  
Never have your testimony questioned or contradicted by evidence. *Admitting you were secretly researching employees damages your reputation.*

**WARNING:** Revealing your secret research for Bodd loses you 3 points. But if cornered, it might be necessary to explain your whereabouts and clear yourself.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Mention working late in the archives, hint at recent unusual requests without revealing specifics. Observe who seems nervous about records.

**Round 2:** Share your discovery about Blackwood's missing history. Reveal the torn registry pages but protect other sensitive information.

**Round 3:** Connect the dots between the missing records and tonight's events. Push for examining everyone's documented history.

## ðŸ”® SPECIAL ABILITY: Perfect Archive Memory
**When to Use:** Once per game during any investigation round  
**How to Activate:** Stand and declare: "I recall something from the archives!"  
**What It Does:** Force any player to answer ONE of these specific questions:

Choose your question:
- "How long have you worked at the Ministry?" 
- "Have you accessed any restricted areas this week?"
- "Have you authorized or handled any potions this month?"
- "Do you have complete employment records on file?"

**The Mechanic:**
- The targeted player MUST answer the specific question truthfully
- They can still lie about everything else
- You get one question only, choose wisely

**Strategic Tip:** Use this to catch someone whose backstory doesn't add up or to verify suspicious behavior.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** NO (just manual research)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** NO

You're clean! You can honestly say: "I've been doing archival research. No magic required for reading documents."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

Your perfect memory and archive access give you unique knowledge:

- **Public Reading Room Hours:** Closes at 6 PM on Sundays, no exceptions
  - *Corroborated by: Quill (frequent visitor) and security logs*
- **Meeting Schedules:** You log every scheduled meeting and tour in the archives
  - *Corroborated by: Your meticulous records and Thorne (who approves special access)*
- **Level 5 Clearance Records:** You maintain the list of who has Level 5 access
  - *Corroborated by: Keats (security chief) and Thorne (who grants it)*
- **Employee Records:** You know Blackwood has NO records before 5 years ago
  - *Corroborated by: Your research and Bodd's notes (if found)*
- **Archive Overtime:** You requested and received overtime approval for tonight
  - *Corroborated by: Thorne (who approved it) and the written authorization*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked exactly where in the archives you were working late:**
You can't reveal you were in the Restricted Section researching Blackwood's suspicious background on Bodd's secret requestâ€”it could make you the next target.
- **The Lie:** "I was in the public reading room reorganizing the genealogy indices."
- **Why This Works:** As the Archivist, reorganizing indices is tedious work you'd do after hours. Genealogy is your specialty, so this is believable. The public room sounds less suspicious than the Restricted Section.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were in the Restricted Section pulling files on Blackwood and other employees with suspicious gaps in their records.

**If asked why you were late to meet Bodd when he specifically requested you:**
You can't admit you were gathering evidence about Blackwood's missing history to show him.
- **The Lie:** "Curator Bales requested an impromptu donor tour of the historical manuscripts. You know how insistent donors can be, and Bales always expects me to drop everything."
- **Why This Works:** Bales is known for bringing wealthy donors around at odd hours. As Archivist, you'd be obligated to assist. This also subtly throws suspicion on Bales.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were photocopying classified documents about Blackwood to give to Bodd, who was murdered before you could deliver them.

## Final Statement
"The truth always leaves traces in the recordsâ€”if you know where to look."
