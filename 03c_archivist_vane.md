# Archivist Nella Vane
*Keeper of Magical Records*

## Public Background
You maintain the Ministry's vast archives of magical contracts, genealogies, and historical records. Your eidetic memory and attention to detail make you invaluable for research and verification.

## Private Information
Two weeks ago, Alaric Bodd asked you to secretly research the genealogy of several Ministry employees, including Agent Vale. You found no records of Vale before five years ago—highly unusual for someone in their position. You were going to report this to Bodd tonight but arrived to find him dead. You also discovered that several pages are missing from the Transmorph Potion registry, torn out last month.

## Known Relationships
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** He trusted you with sensitive research
- **Agent Vale:** The subject of your suspicious findings
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Often requests historical wand records from you
- **Prophet Correspondent Quill:** Frequently pesters you for information for their stories

## Personal Goals
1. Reveal what you learned about the missing records
2. Determine who has been tampering with the archives
3. Protect the integrity of magical records
4. Share Bodd's research without becoming the next target

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Mention working late in the archives, hint at recent unusual requests without revealing specifics. Observe who seems nervous about records.

**Round 2:** Share your discovery about Vale's missing history. Reveal the torn registry pages but protect other sensitive information.

**Round 3:** Connect the dots between the missing records and tonight's events. Push for examining everyone's documented history.

## Optional Spell Card
**Perfect Recall:** Once per game, you may cite a "document you remember" that establishes one factual detail about the Ministry or its procedures (cannot directly identify the murderer).

## Final Statement
"The truth always leaves traces in the records—if you know where to look."
