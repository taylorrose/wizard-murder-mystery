## How to Read Evidence (Say this aloud once)
When examining evidence, ask yourself:
- **What does it literally show?** Read the facts first
- **Why does it matter tonight?** Connect it to the timeline
- **Who does it help or hurt?** Consider alibis and motives
- **What should we check next?** Follow the leads

## Printing Instructions
1. Print pages single-sided for easier cutting
2. Cut along the dotted lines (- - - -)
3. Sort into three piles by round (A, B, C)
4. Place each round's evidence in separate envelopes
5. Distribute only when the script indicates

**[PERSONAL NOTES - ALARIC BODD'S HANDWRITING]**

```
Research Notes - CONFIDENTIAL
Day 12 of Memory Extraction Project

The Minister insists on transparency but 
someone ELSE wants this buried. Why?

Blackwood's records don't match. Vane confirmed—
no history before 5 years ago. Identity 
constructed? But by whom?

Must be careful. The Mirror could reveal 
truth but T.B. says it's secured. Don't 
believe him—old friends protect each other.

Remember: "M. Cross" - This name keeps appearing 
in removed files. Who is M. Cross???

If something happens to me, check the Time Room. 
Mire knows more than he admits.

The walls have eyes. Trust no one.
Even the Minister may not be the Minister.
```

**Release Timing:** Round 2 - Evidence B

URGENT - SECURITY BREACH ALERT

The Mirror of Masks is MISSING from Vault 7
Last documented: One week ago
Reported by: Automated inventory (not staff)

Mirror Properties:
- Projects false appearance for ~10 minutes
- Requires no potion or spell
- Can layer over existing disguises
- Shows user's true desire in reflection

Security Note: Vault accessed with legitimate
credentials belonging to T. Bales. Multiple
after-hours entries logged for "donor tours"
which violate Protocol 12-C.

If Mirror was used tonight, look for:
- Briefly flickering appearances
- Confusion about recent interactions  
- 10-minute gaps in alibis

WARNING: Mirror may still be active in building

## Evidence C-3: Previous Minister's Final Entry

**[RECOVERED JOURNAL - DATED 6 MONTHS AGO]**

```
Personal Log - Minister Cordelia Blackthorne
[Final Entry]

I've discovered something terrible. Someone
in my inner circle is not who they claim.
The evidence points to a long-term infiltration,
but by whom? For what purpose?

Meeting tonight with [SMUDGED] to confront
them. I've told only Alaric Bodd of my
suspicions—he's researching memory magic
that might reveal the truth.

If something happens to me, know this:
- The corruption goes deeper than imagined
- Check the Transmorph authorization logs
- "Blackwood" is significant somehow
- Trust no one who joined within 5 years

The Ministry's foundation is compromised.
Act carefully.

[Entry ends here. Minister disappeared that night]
```

**Release Timing:** Round 3 - Evidence C  
**Investigative Value:** Connects current murder to previous disappearance
