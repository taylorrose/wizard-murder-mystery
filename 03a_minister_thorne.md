# Minister Aldric Thorne
*Acting Minister of Wonders*

## Public Background
You are the ambitious Acting Minister, appointed six months ago after the previous Minister's mysterious disappearance. You've been implementing controversial reforms to increase transparency in the Ministry's operations, making enemies among those who prefer the old secretive ways.

## Private Information
You authorized the Transmorph Potion batch that was stolen last month, signing off on it for "Auror training purposes." You fear this connection to the murder weapon could destroy your career. You also had a heated argument with Alaric Bodd last week about his research into memory modification‚Äîyou suspected he was hiding something dangerous from Ministry oversight. You were in the Minister's office reviewing classified files when the body was discovered, but you can't reveal what files without compromising national security.

### üî¥ YOUR DARKEST SECRET üî¥
**YOU KILLED THE PREVIOUS MINISTER**
- You murdered Minister Cordelia Blackthorne 6 months ago
- She discovered your embezzlement of Ministry funds  
- You staged it as a "disappearance" and destroyed evidence
- The Transmorph authorization could unravel everything
- You are NOT tonight's killer, but you're still a murderer

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
In the Minister's Office reviewing classified files concerning security drills and the prior Minister's disappearance. Destroying evidence of your crimes. Security log shows you proximate at 19:31.

## Known Relationships
- **Commander Keats:** Your most trusted ally, though you worry she knows about the potion authorization
- **Inquisitor March:** Constantly questioning your reforms and authority
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** He resisted your transparency initiatives
- **Curator Bales:** Old family friend who got their position through your recommendation

## Personal Goals
1. Maintain your position and authority
2. Keep the Transmorph authorization secret
3. Hide your murder of Blackthorne
4. Discover what Bodd was really researching
5. Identify who might be targeting Ministry leadership

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Political Survival (4 points)**  
When Evidence A-1 (potion label) shows "Authorization: A. Th...", deflect suspicion successfully. No one should directly accuse you of authorizing it by Round 2's end. *This requires keeping your authorization secret.*

**Maintain Authority (3 points)**  
Avoid being pointed to as "most suspicious" during the round-end suspicion votes. Your position must remain respected. *Revealing your secrets undermines your authority.*

**Deflect Upward (2 points)**  
Successfully argue that the crime indicates corruption above your level (previous Minister, etc.) without being contradicted. *Admitting your role destroys this narrative.*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SCORING INFORMATION ‚ö†Ô∏è
**As the Previous Murderer (of Blackthorne):**
- If your Transmorph authorization is revealed: **-5 points**
- If your murder of Blackthorne is exposed: **AUTOMATIC LOSS** (0 total points)
- If wrongly identified as tonight's killer: Normal scoring applies
- You can still win by avoiding exposure and scoring other points

**Strategic Note:** You may need to reveal the authorization to avoid being wrongly accused of tonight's murder. This costs 5 points but keeps you in the game. NEVER admit to killing Blackthorne.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Establish your authority while subtly determining who had access to your office. Express concern about the lockdown but maintain calm leadership.

**Round 2:** When the Transmorph evidence surfaces, deflect from your authorization. Focus suspicion on those with potion knowledge or access to secure areas.

**Round 3:** If pressured about the authorization, claim it was a classified security measure. Push for quick resolution to maintain Ministry stability.

## Special Ability: NONE
As the guilty party (Blackthorne's murderer), you have no special ability. Your power comes from your position and authority, not magic. Use political maneuvering and deflection instead.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** YES (incendiary spells to destroy evidence)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** NO

You can lie about WHY: "Standard ministerial protection charms and document security spells. Routine administrative magic."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

You don't know it, but you have information that can catch others in their deceptions:

- **Level 5 Clearance Changes:** You know all Level 5 codes were changed last week
  - *Corroborated by: Keats (security chief) and March (investigates clearance abuse)*
- **Archive Overtime:** You approved overtime for archive staff‚Äîno one should have been there after 6 PM except Vane
  - *Corroborated by: Vane (who requested the overtime) and Quill (who was denied after-hours access)*
- **Medical Inventory Audit:** You personally reviewed the audit last week showing all potions accounted for
  - *Corroborated by: Dredge (who conducted it) and March (who requested it for investigation)*
- **Hall of Enigmas Maintenance:** You know it was supposed to be sealed for maintenance tonight
  - *Corroborated by: Mire (works there) and Bales (coordinates with maintenance for artifact moves)*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked what files you were reviewing in your office:**
You can't admit you were destroying evidence of your embezzlement and murder of Minister Blackthorne.
- **The Lie:** "I was reviewing diplomatic cables from our French counterparts, not potion logs."
- **Why This Works:** Diplomatic cables are highly classified and you can't share details due to international security. This gives you a legitimate reason to be secretive about what you were reading. The French Ministry sends cables every Sunday for Monday morning review.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were actually burning financial records and correspondence that would reveal you killed Blackthorne.

**If asked about authorizing the Transmorph Potion (Evidence A1 shows your signature):**
You can't let them realize the murder weapon came from your authorized batch.
- **The Lie:** "That was routine paperwork from last month. I sign dozens of training authorizations. The batch was for next quarter's Auror training exercises and should still be in secure storage."
- **Why This Works:** Ministers do sign many authorizations, and training requests are common. By saying it's for future use, you're suggesting the batch couldn't be the murder weapon. Auror training regularly uses restricted potions under controlled conditions.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You authorized Batch #221B for immediate use in a security drill. The impostor stole it using your authorization as cover.

**If asked why security logs show you near your office at 7:31 PM:**
You can't admit you were panicking and destroying evidence.
- **The Lie:** "Those are routine decoy sweeps. Security runs false positive pings near high-value offices to confuse potential intruders. The real me could have been anywhere."
- **Why This Works:** Decoy sweeps are a real security measure (though Keats knows they only run on Tuesdays). It makes you sound security-conscious rather than suspicious.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were really there, frantically destroying anything that could link you to Blackthorne's murder.

## Final Statement
"The Ministry's very foundation rests upon trust‚Äîtrust that has been shattered tonight."
