# Wandwright Cassian Thorn
*Magical Equipment Division*

## Public Background
You craft and maintain the Ministry's specialized magical equipment, from Auror wands to detection devices. Your workshop contains both standard and experimental items.

## Private Information
You've been illegally modifying wands for select clients, removing the tracking charms that allow the Ministry to trace spell usage. One of your modified wands was picked up yesterday, paid for in advance by someone using the name "R. Kett"—a name that doesn't appear in any Ministry records. You were with Healer Dredge getting a burn treated (from a wand experiment) when Bodd was discovered. You also know that Bodd had requested a special wand "that couldn't be traced" last week.

## Known Relationships
- **Healer Dredge:** Your alibi for the time of murder
- **Archivist Vane:** You request historical wand records
- **Magizoologist Finn:** Provides rare creature materials for wands
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Recent request for untraceable wand

## Personal Goals
1. Keep your illegal modifications secret
2. Discover who "R. Kett" really is
3. Avoid being blamed for providing the murder weapon
4. Determine why Bodd wanted an untraceable wand

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Establish your alibi with Dredge strongly. Ask technical questions about how the murder was committed, fishing for wand involvement.

**Round 2:** When wand evidence surfaces, reveal that someone ordered a modified wand but don't admit to making it unless pressed.

**Round 3:** Share the "R. Kett" name and suggest this might be the impostor's real identity. Admit Bodd wanted an untraceable wand if it helps prove your innocence.

## Optional Spell Card  
**Wand Diagnostic:** Once per game, you may claim to recognize "spell patterns" on someone, suggesting they cast specific magic recently.

## Final Statement
"A wand remembers every spell it casts—as should its wielder."
