# Wandwright Cassian Thorn
*Magical Equipment Division*

## Public Background
You craft and maintain the Ministry's specialized magical equipment, from Auror wands to detection devices. Your workshop contains both standard and experimental items.

## Private Information
You've been illegally modifying wands for select clients, removing the tracking charms that allow the Ministry to trace spell usage. One of your modified wands was picked up yesterday, paid for in advance by someone using the name "M. Cross"—a name that doesn't appear in any Ministry records. You were with Healer Dredge getting a burn treated (from a wand experiment) when Bodd was discovered. You also know that Bodd had requested a special wand "that couldn't be traced" last week.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
In the Medical Wing with Healer Dredge getting a burn treated. Started treatment at ~7:25, still there at alarm. Dredge is your alibi.

### Your Darkest Secret
You owe significant gambling debts to dangerous people. The illegal wand modifications pay well—it's the only thing keeping your creditors from collecting violently. You made the murder weapon.

### Why You Lie
Illegal wand modification is serious Azkaban time. Plus, your creditors would kill you if the income stops. You can't admit you provided the untraceable wand used in the murder.

## Known Relationships
- **Healer Dredge:** Your alibi for the time of murder
- **Archivist Vane:** You request historical wand records
- **Magizoologist Finn:** Provides rare creature materials for wands
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Recent request for untraceable wand

## Personal Goals
1. Keep your illegal modifications secret
2. Discover who "M. Cross" really is
3. Avoid being blamed for providing the murder weapon
4. Determine why Bodd wanted an untraceable wand

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Technical Expertise (4 points)**  
Use Wand Diagnostic to correctly identify spell traces on the actual murderer. *Admitting you make illegal wands destroys your credibility as an expert.*

**Plausible Denial (3 points)**  
When Evidence B-2 reveals an untraceable wand, successfully argue it came from outside sources (Knockturn Alley, etc.). *Your illegal modifications directly contradict this.*

**Name the Buyer (2 points)**  
Correctly identify that "M. Cross" is connected to Agent Blackwood before anyone else does. *Revealing you made the wand makes you an accomplice.*

**WARNING:** Revealing your illegal modifications loses you 10 points and risks Azkaban. But if Evidence B-2 and the "M. Cross" connection point directly to you, confession might be your only defense against being named the murderer.

**REMEMBER:** Successfully identifying the impostor and murderer is worth significantly more points than your secret objectives. But only if the group succeeds. Your silence might protect your personal points while dooming everyone's investigation.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Establish your alibi with Dredge strongly. Ask technical questions about how the murder was committed, fishing for wand involvement.

**Round 2:** When wand evidence surfaces, reveal that someone ordered a modified wand but don't admit to making it unless pressed.

**Round 3:** Share the "M. Cross" name and suggest this might be the impostor's real identity. Admit Bodd wanted an untraceable wand if it helps prove your innocence.

## Special Ability: NONE
You made the murder weapon but have no special detection abilities. Your guilty knowledge about illegal wands is burden enough.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** YES (wand testing spells)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** YES (healing salves for burn)
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** YES (healing salves still active)

You can lie about WHY: "Wand calibration tests and healing salves from a workshop accident. Occupational hazards of wandcrafting."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

Your technical expertise reveals important details:

- **Burn Treatment Timeline:** You remember every detail of your medical treatment
  - *Corroborated by: Dredge (who treated you) and medical records*
- **Wand Modification Signatures:** You can identify magical signatures from modified wands
  - *Corroborated by: Evidence B2 (wand analysis) showing unregistered wand*
- **Workshop Security:** You know who has access to wand-crafting tools
  - *Corroborated by: Department logs and security protocols*
- **Illegal Modification Costs:** Black market wand mods cost 200 Galleons minimum
  - *Corroborated by: Underground price lists (if found)*
- **Burn Patterns:** You know which burns come from legal vs illegal work
  - *Corroborated by: Dredge (medical expert) and your injuries*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked about modified wands:**
You can't admit you remove tracking charms for paying clients.
- **The Lie:** "I refused the request for an untraceable wand. It's highly illegal. I told them to try Knockturn Alley dealers instead."
- **Why This Works:** Refusing shows integrity. Knockturn Alley is known for black market wands. This deflects blame while acknowledging the request happened.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You made the wand for "M. Cross" yesterday and Bodd's last week. The money kept your legs from being broken.

**If asked about your burn:**
You can't admit it came from rushing an illegal modification.
- **The Lie:** "The burn came from a standard wand core stability test around 7:20. Dragon heartstring flared unexpectedly."
- **Why This Works:** Core stability tests are routine. Dragon heartstring is notoriously unstable. The timing fits your medical treatment.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You burned yourself rushing to complete M. Cross's untraceable wand order because they paid triple for express service.

## Revealing Your Deepest Secret

- If your illegal wand modifications are revealed publicly, you will lose points. However, revealing them may be the only credible way to clear yourself of suspicion for Bodd's murder. Choose strategically.

## Final Statement
"A wand remembers every spell it casts—as should its wielder."
