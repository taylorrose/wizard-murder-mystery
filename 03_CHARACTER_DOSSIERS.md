## 1. Minister Odran Pyke
*Acting Minister of Wonders*

### Public Background
You are the ambitious Acting Minister, appointed six months ago after the previous Minister's mysterious disappearance. You've been implementing controversial reforms to increase transparency in the Ministry's operations, making enemies among those who prefer the old secretive ways.

### Private Information
You authorized the Transmorph Potion batch that was stolen last month, signing off on it for "Auror training purposes." You fear this connection to the murder weapon could destroy your career. You also had a heated argument with Alaric Bodd last week about his research into memory modification—you suspected he was hiding something dangerous from Ministry oversight. You were in the Minister's office reviewing classified files when the body was discovered, but you can't reveal what files without compromising national security.

### Known Relationships
- **Commander Keats:** Your most trusted ally, though you worry she knows about the potion authorization
- **Inquisitor March:** Constantly questioning your reforms and authority
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** He resisted your transparency initiatives
- **Curator Bales:** Old family friend who got their position through your recommendation

### Personal Goals
1. Maintain your position and authority
2. Keep the Transmorph authorization secret
3. Discover what Bodd was really researching
4. Identify who might be targeting Ministry leadership

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Establish your authority while subtly determining who had access to your office. Express concern about the lockdown but maintain calm leadership.

**Round 2:** When the Transmorph evidence surfaces, deflect from your authorization. Focus suspicion on those with potion knowledge or access to secure areas.

**Round 3:** If pressured about the authorization, claim it was a classified security measure. Push for quick resolution to maintain Ministry stability.

### Optional Spell Card
**Authority Seal:** Once per game, you may demand a direct answer to one question from one player, invoking ministerial privilege. They must answer truthfully to that specific question (they may still lie about other things).

### Final Statement
"The Ministry's very foundation rests upon trust—trust that has been shattered tonight."

### Scaling Notes
Essential character. Cannot be removed.

## 2. Auror Commander Brina Keats
*Head of Magical Law Enforcement*

### Public Background
You are the decorated head of the Auror Office, known for your methodical investigation style and unshakeable loyalty to the Ministry. You've served for fifteen years, rising through the ranks after solving the Goblin Vault conspiracy.

### Private Information
You discovered irregularities in the security logs three days ago—someone has been accessing restricted areas using high-level clearance codes. You suspect corruption at the highest levels but haven't reported it yet because the access codes belonged to the Minister. You were investigating these breaches in the security office when Bodd died. Additionally, you've been secretly investigating the previous Minister's disappearance, believing it wasn't voluntary.

### Known Relationships
- **Minister Pyke:** Your direct superior, whom you're beginning to doubt
- **Agent Vale:** One of your special operations contacts, though something seems off about them lately
- **Healer Dredge:** Worked together on several cases involving magical maladies
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** He recently requested Auror protection but wouldn't say why

### Personal Goals
1. Uncover the truth about the security breaches
2. Determine if Ministry leadership is compromised  
3. Identify the impostor before they can escape
4. Protect the innocent while maintaining order

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Question everyone about their movements tonight. Take charge of organizing information without revealing your suspicions about the Minister.

**Round 2:** When evidence points to inside knowledge, press those with high clearance. Share concerns about security breaches but not who they implicate.

**Round 3:** If the Minister seems guilty, you must choose between duty and justice. Consider revealing what you know about the previous Minister's disappearance.

### Optional Spell Card
**Auror's Insight:** Twice per game, after someone makes a statement, you may announce "That contradicts evidence I've found." They must either admit to lying or provide more detail.

### Final Statement
"In fifteen years of service, I've never seen deception run this deep."

### Scaling Notes
Essential character. Cannot be removed.

## 3. Archivist Nella Vane
*Keeper of Magical Records*

### Public Background
You maintain the Ministry's vast archives of magical contracts, genealogies, and historical records. Your eidetic memory and attention to detail make you invaluable for research and verification.

### Private Information
Two weeks ago, Alaric Bodd asked you to secretly research the genealogy of several Ministry employees, including Agent Vale. You found no records of Vale before five years ago—highly unusual for someone in their position. You were going to report this to Bodd tonight but arrived to find him dead. You also discovered that several pages are missing from the Transmorph Potion registry, torn out last month.

### Known Relationships
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** He trusted you with sensitive research
- **Agent Vale:** The subject of your suspicious findings
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Often requests historical wand records from you
- **Prophet Correspondent Quill:** Frequently pestera you for information for their stories

### Personal Goals
1. Reveal what you learned about the missing records
2. Determine who has been tampering with the archives
3. Protect the integrity of magical records
4. Share Bodd's research without becoming the next target

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Mention working late in the archives, hint at recent unusual requests without revealing specifics. Observe who seems nervous about records.

**Round 2:** Share your discovery about Vale's missing history. Reveal the torn registry pages but protect other sensitive information.

**Round 3:** Connect the dots between the missing records and tonight's events. Push for examining everyone's documented history.

### Optional Spell Card
**Perfect Recall:** Once per game, you may cite a "document you remember" that establishes one factual detail about the Ministry or its procedures (cannot directly identify the murderer).

### Final Statement
"The truth always leaves traces in the records—if you know where to look."

### Scaling Notes
If removed (11 players), transfer the Vale discovery to Commander Keats.

## 4. Healer Corwin Dredge
*Chief Medi-Wizard*

### Public Background
You are the Ministry's chief medical officer, responsible for the health and well-being of all employees. Your expertise in magical maladies and potions is unmatched.

### Private Information
You performed the preliminary examination of Bodd's body and found traces of both Transmorph Potion and a rare paralyzing agent. The combination suggests someone wanted him alive but helpless before the killing blow. You signed off on Transmorph Potion for medical research last year, but three vials went missing from your stores. You didn't report it to avoid admitting your security lapse. You were treating a minor injury for the Wandwright when the alarm sounded.

### Known Relationships
- **Minister Pyke:** You've treated them for stress-related ailments
- **Commander Keats:** Worked together on poison cases
- **Wandwright Thorn:** They were with you when Bodd was discovered
- **Magizoologist Finn:** Consults with you on creature-related injuries

### Personal Goals
1. Reveal medical findings strategically
2. Keep the missing vials secret if possible
3. Identify who has medical knowledge to use such a combination
4. Determine if the paralyzing agent was meant for Bodd or someone else

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Share basic medical findings (death by magical means). Establish your alibi with Thorn. Ask about anyone with potion knowledge.

**Round 2:** Reveal the paralysis detail. If pressed about Transmorph access, deflect to others who might have stolen it.

**Round 3:** If the missing vials are discovered, admit the theft but emphasize you're clearly not the impostor since you're revealing medical evidence.

### Optional Spell Card
**Diagnostic Charm:** Once per game, you may examine one player and declare one of the following: "They show signs of recent spell damage," "They've consumed a potion tonight," or "They're in perfect health."

### Final Statement
"The medical evidence doesn't lie—but someone here certainly does."

### Scaling Notes
Essential for evidence chain. If removed in 9-player game, transfer medical findings to Commander Keats.

## 5. Inquisitor Selwyn March
*Department of Magical Law - Integrity Division*

### Public Background
You investigate corruption and misconduct within the Ministry itself. Your reputation for ruthless pursuit of truth makes you both respected and feared.

### Private Information
You've been building a case against Minister Pyke for abuse of power, including unauthorized use of restricted potions. Bodd was going to be your key witness—he had promised to testify about Pyke's pressure to suppress his research. You were in Bodd's office earlier today, planning his testimony, and noticed he seemed terrified of something beyond just Pyke. You have a recording crystal with Bodd's voice saying "The Minister is not the Minister" but you don't understand what he meant.

### Known Relationships
- **Minister Pyke:** Your primary investigation target
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Your would-be star witness
- **Prophet Correspondent Quill:** They've been trying to get information about your investigations
- **Curator Bales:** You suspect they got their position through nepotism

### Personal Goals
1. Continue your investigation despite losing your witness
2. Determine if Bodd's death relates to your case
3. Understand Bodd's cryptic warning about the Minister
4. Expose corruption even if it reaches the highest levels

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Probe the Minister's activities without revealing your investigation. Ask pointed questions about who benefits from Bodd's death.

**Round 2:** Share Bodd's cryptic message about the Minister. Press those with connections to Pyke about their loyalty.

**Round 3:** Reveal the full scope of your investigation. Demand answers about the Transmorph authorization and suggest the Minister might be the impostor.

### Optional Spell Card
**Truth Compulsion:** Once per game, declare "Under ministerial law, I compel truth!" The next statement by target player must be partially true (they choose what part).

### Final Statement
"Corruption spreads like poison—and tonight, we see its deadly fruit."

### Scaling Notes
If removed (10 players), transfer the investigation angle to Commander Keats and the crystal to Archivist Vane.

## 6. Magizoologist Elara Finn
*Department of Creature Relations*

### Public Background
You oversee the Ministry's magical creature affairs, from dragon incidents to house-elf rights. Your compassionate approach often puts you at odds with those who see creatures as tools or threats.

### Private Information
You were investigating illegal trafficking of Metamorphmagus hair—a key ingredient in enhanced Transmorph Potion that extends transformation time. Your investigation led to someone inside the Ministry, but you haven't identified who. Bodd had asked for your expertise last week about "creature-based transformation" but you thought it was academic curiosity. You were in the creature holding area feeding the messenger owls when the body was discovered.

### Known Relationships
- **Healer Dredge:** Regular consultation on creature injuries
- **Curator Bales:** They sometimes acquire creature artifacts for display
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Recent unusual interest in transformation
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Their wands sometimes use rare creature components

### Personal Goals
1. Share your trafficking discovery without endangering your investigation
2. Determine if enhanced Transmorph was used tonight
3. Protect innocent creatures from being blamed
4. Identify the trafficking connection inside the Ministry

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Establish your alibi with the owls. Mention the trafficking investigation vaguely, observing reactions.

**Round 2:** Reveal the Metamorphmagus hair connection to Transmorph enhancement. Question who would need extended transformation time.

**Round 3:** Connect Bodd's questions to tonight's events. Suggest the impostor might have used enhanced potion for longer infiltration.

### Optional Spell Card
**Creature Sense:** Twice per game, you may declare that you sense "predator behavior" or "prey behavior" from a player, suggesting their aggressive or defensive posture.

### Final Statement
"Even the most dangerous creature shows its true nature when cornered."

### Scaling Notes
If removed (9 players), transfer creature trafficking information to Healer Dredge.

## 7. Curator Theon Bales
*Hall of Magical Artifacts*

### Public Background
You oversee the Ministry's collection of powerful magical artifacts, ensuring their safety and studying their properties. Your expertise in ancient magic is frequently called upon.

### Private Information
The Mirror of Masks—an artifact that can project false appearances for about 10 minutes—went missing from your vault last week. You didn't report it because you'd been showing it to unauthorized visitors (wealthy donors) to secure funding. Bodd had been researching the Mirror's connection to memory magic. You were in the vault doing inventory to cover up the missing Mirror when the alarm sounded. You're also Minister Pyke's childhood friend who helped you get this position.

### Known Relationships
- **Minister Pyke:** Old friend who recommended you for the position
- **Inquisitor March:** They've been questioning your qualifications
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Researching artifacts in your collection
- **Unspeakable Mire:** Sometimes borrows temporal artifacts from you

### Personal Goals
1. Hide the Mirror's disappearance as long as possible
2. Protect your reputation and position
3. Determine if the Mirror was used in tonight's crime
4. Maintain the Minister's trust while avoiding suspicion

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Focus on your expertise rather than the missing item. Support the Minister subtly. Establish your vault alibi.

**Round 2:** If pressed about artifacts that could aid imposture, reluctantly mention the Mirror of Masks but claim it's secure.

**Round 3:** When the Mirror's absence is revealed, explain your donor visits but insist you're not the impostor—you wouldn't need the Mirror to deceive.

### Optional Spell Card
**Artifact Resonance:** Once per game, you may claim to sense that someone has "recently handled a powerful magical object" (choose any player).

### Final Statement
"Artifacts are tools—it's the hand that wields them that determines their purpose."

### Scaling Notes
Essential for Mirror of Masks plot. Cannot be removed unless removing that evidence thread.

## 8. Prophet Correspondent Lyra Quill
*Press Liaison & Ministry Reporter*

### Public Background
You are the Daily Prophet's dedicated Ministry correspondent, always seeking the next big story. Your articles have exposed several minor scandals, making you unpopular with those who prefer secrecy.

### Private Information
You've been investigating the previous Minister's disappearance and believe there's a conspiracy at the highest levels. Bodd had agreed to be an anonymous source about "something huge" happening in the Hall of Enigmas. You have a partially burned memo you found in a waste bin suggesting someone was planning to "replace" a Ministry official. You were trying to sneak into the restricted archives when the body was discovered.

### Known Relationships
- **Inquisitor March:** You've been trying to get information about their investigations
- **Archivist Vane:** Your frequent source for historical context
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Your newest anonymous source
- **Enchanter Rune:** They've given you quotes about magical theory before

### Personal Goals
1. Get the story of the century
2. Expose the conspiracy you've been tracking
3. Protect your sources while gathering evidence
4. Survive to publish the truth

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Fish for information while appearing to offer tid-bits about your investigations. Mention Bodd was going to tell you something important.

**Round 2:** Share the burned memo about "replacement." Press for information about the previous Minister's fate.

**Round 3:** Threaten to publish everything you've learned unless the truth comes out. Connect the conspiracy to tonight's murder.

### Optional Spell Card
**Quick-Quotes Quill:** Once per game, you may "quote" something another player said earlier, even if it's slightly paraphrased to be more incriminating.

### Final Statement
"The public deserves the truth—and I'll make sure they get it."

### Scaling Notes
If removed (11 players), transfer press angle and burned memo to Inquisitor March.

## 9. Wandwright Cassian Thorn
*Magical Equipment Division*

### Public Background
You craft and maintain the Ministry's specialized magical equipment, from Auror wands to detection devices. Your workshop contains both standard and experimental items.

### Private Information
You've been illegally modifying wands for select clients, removing the tracking charms that allow the Ministry to trace spell usage. One of your modified wands was picked up yesterday, paid for in advance by someone using the name "R. Kett"—a name that doesn't appear in any Ministry records. You were with Healer Dredge getting a burn treated (from a wand experiment) when Bodd was discovered. You also know that Bodd had requested a special wand "that couldn't be traced" last week.

### Known Relationships
- **Healer Dredge:** Your alibi for the time of murder
- **Archivist Vane:** You request historical wand records
- **Magizoologist Finn:** Provides rare creature materials for wands
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Recent request for untraceable wand

### Personal Goals
1. Keep your illegal modifications secret
2. Discover who "R. Kett" really is
3. Avoid being blamed for providing the murder weapon
4. Determine why Bodd wanted an untraceable wand

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Establish your alibi with Dredge strongly. Ask technical questions about how the murder was committed, fishing for wand involvement.

**Round 2:** When wand evidence surfaces, reveal that someone ordered a modified wand but don't admit to making it unless pressed.

**Round 3:** Share the "R. Kett" name and suggest this might be the impostor's real identity. Admit Bodd wanted an untraceable wand if it helps prove your innocence.

### Optional Spell Card  
**Wand Diagnostic:** Once per game, you may claim to recognize "spell patterns" on someone, suggesting they cast specific magic recently.

### Final Statement
"A wand remembers every spell it casts—as should its wielder."

### Scaling Notes
If removed (10 players), transfer wand modification plot to Agent Vale discovery.

## 10. Unspeakable Dorian Mire
*Hall of Time - Temporal Research*

### Public Background
You research time magic in the Department of Mysteries' most classified division. Your work involves prophecies, time loops, and temporal paradoxes that few understand.

### Private Information
You and Bodd were working on a project involving memory extraction across temporal gaps—essentially viewing memories from the future or past. The project was ordered classified by someone above Bodd, and he was growing paranoid about why. You've been experiencing temporal echoes all day—brief visions of possible futures, including one where you saw yourself dead. You were in the Time Room when Bodd died, but time moves strangely there—you could have been gone for minutes or hours.

### Known Relationships
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Fellow Unspeakable and research partner
- **Curator Bales:** You borrow temporal artifacts from them
- **Enchanter Rune:** They help with complex spell work
- **Minister Pyke:** The one pushing for more transparency in your department

### Personal Goals
1. Protect the classified research from exposure
2. Understand why Bodd was killed
3. Determine if the temporal echoes are warning you
4. Identify who classified your joint project

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Be vague about your whereabouts (time distortion). Mention working with Bodd but not on what. Observe who seems to know about your research.

**Round 2:** Share your temporal echoes, including seeing yourself dead. Reveal the memory extraction project but not its full implications.

**Round 3:** Suggest the murderer might have known about future memories. Reveal who classified the project if you've identified them.

### Optional Spell Card
**Temporal Echo:** Once per game, you may claim to have "seen a echo of this moment" and ask one player to repeat their last statement, suggesting inconsistency.

### Final Statement
"Time reveals all secrets—past, present, and future."

### Scaling Notes
Essential for the Hall of Enigmas subplot. If needed, can merge with Enchanter Rune role.

## 11. Enchanter Vexa Rune
*Experimental Spellcraft Division*

### Public Background
You develop new spells and modify existing ones for Ministry use. Your brilliant but unconventional approach has led to both breakthroughs and spectacular failures.

### Private Information
You've been secretly developing a spell to detect Transmorph Potion users—a commission from someone who contacted you anonymously with significant payment. The spell is almost complete but requires a rare component: essence from someone currently transformed. You had arranged to meet Bodd tonight because he claimed to have information about unauthorized Transmorph use. You were in your workshop testing the detection spell when the alarm sounded.

### Known Relationships
- **Unspeakable Mire:** Collaborate on complex temporal spells
- **Prophet Correspondent Quill:** You've given interviews about magical theory
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Was going to provide information tonight
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Sometimes collaborate on spell-channeling equipment

### Personal Goals
1. Complete your detection spell
2. Discover who commissioned it and why
3. Use the spell to identify the impostor
4. Protect your reputation if the spell fails

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Hint at working on something revolutionary. Ask if anyone has noticed unusual magical signatures tonight.

**Round 2:** Reveal you're developing a Transmorph detection spell. Suggest you could complete it if you had a transformed sample.

**Round 3:** Attempt to use your incomplete spell, claiming you can narrow down suspects even if not identify exactly. Push for group cooperation.

### Optional Spell Card
**Experimental Detection:** Once per game, wave your wand at the group and claim your spell reveals "someone here has an unstable magical aura." Create suspicion without identifying anyone specific.

### Final Statement
"Magic leaves traces for those who know how to look—and I've been looking very carefully."

### Scaling Notes
If removed (10 players), transfer detection spell to Unspeakable Mire's temporal research.

## 12. Agent Merin Vale (Special Operations Liaison)

### Public Background
You are a Special Operations Liaison, handling sensitive missions between the Auror Office and other departments. Your record shows five years of exemplary service with numerous commendations for undercover work.

### Private Information
Your public record is impeccable—perhaps too impeccable. You've been involved in several high-profile cases that brought you into contact with most Ministry departments. You were supposedly meeting with Bodd about a security matter when he was discovered dead, though you arrived moments after the alarm sounded. You have detailed knowledge of Ministry procedures that sometimes surprises even veteran employees.

### Known Relationships
- **Commander Keats:** Your supposed superior in special operations
- **Archivist Vane:** Has been researching your background
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Were scheduled to meet tonight
- **Minister Pyke:** You've briefed them on several operations

### Personal Goals
1. Maintain your cover identity
2. Complete your mission (whatever that might be)
3. Avoid detection by those investigating
4. Adapt to unexpected circumstances

### Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Be helpful but not too knowledgeable. Support the investigation while deflecting personal questions. Establish you just arrived.

**Round 2:** When your missing records are mentioned, have a plausible explanation ready (classified operations, witness protection, etc.).

**Round 3:** If pressured, lean into being mysterious but not necessarily guilty. Perhaps you're investigating something yourself?

### Optional Spell Card
**Field Training:** Once per game, you may demonstrate surprising knowledge about any Ministry department or procedure, claiming "special operations training."

### Final Statement
"In my line of work, nothing is ever quite what it seems."

### Scaling Notes
ESSENTIAL CHARACTER - Contains impostor secret. Cannot be removed.

## ⚠️ SEALED SECTION - PLACE IN SEPARATE ENVELOPE ⚠️

### *DO NOT OPEN UNTIL DIRECTED - TRANSMORPH SECRET*

**FOR AGENT MERIN VALE'S PLAYER ONLY**

✂ - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

### YOUR TRUE IDENTITY: Rowan Kett

You are not Merin Vale. The real Agent Vale is unconscious in a safe house, kept alive to maintain the Transmorph connection. You are Rowan Kett, a former Ministry employee who was wrongfully dismissed and obliviated five years ago for discovering corruption.

You've spent years planning this infiltration to expose the truth about the previous Minister's disappearance—they were murdered by someone currently in this room who then covered it up. Alaric Bodd had discovered your true identity through his memory research and was going to expose you tonight, forcing you to act.

**The Transmorph Potion:** You took an enhanced version ninety minutes ago using Metamorphmagus hair, giving you about 3-4 hours total. By Round 3, you'll start showing signs of reversion—occasional flickers, moments of forgetting Vale's mannerisms, etc.

**Your Mission:** You came here to gather evidence about the previous Minister's murder, not to kill anyone. But Bodd's discovery forced your hand. You used a modified wand (purchased from someone in this room under your real name) to paralyze him, then staged the scene to look like multiple suspects could be guilty.

**What You Know:**
- Minister Pyke authorized the Transmorph that was "stolen" (you stole it)
- Commander Keats is investigating the previous Minister's disappearance  
- The Curator's Mirror of Masks could have helped you but was already missing
- Someone else here is also hiding a major secret about that night

**Critical:** You don't know who killed the previous Minister, only that it was someone now present. You're trying to force them to reveal themselves while avoiding your own exposure.

**Behavioral Cues:**
- Round 1: Perfect impersonation
- Round 2: Occasional hesitation on personal details about Vale
- Round 3: Physical flickers, forgetting names momentarily, sweating

**If Accused:** You can maintain innocence until the Unmasking Charm. Your defense is that you came to expose corruption, not commit murder. The real murderer is whoever killed the previous Minister—and they're still among the group.
