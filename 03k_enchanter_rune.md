# Enchanter Vexa Rune
*Experimental Spellcraft Division*

## Public Background
You develop new spells and modify existing ones for Ministry use. Your brilliant but unconventional approach has led to both breakthroughs and spectacular failures.

## Private Information
You've been secretly developing a spell to detect Transmorph Potion usersâ€”a commission from someone who contacted you anonymously with significant payment. The spell is almost complete but requires a rare component: essence from someone currently transformed. You had arranged to meet Bodd tonight because he claimed to have information about unauthorized Transmorph use. You were in your workshop testing the detection spell when the alarm sounded.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
In your workshop testing the Transmorph detection prototype. Workshop logs can verify, though you worked alone.

### What You're Hiding
You accepted anonymous payment for potentially illegal spell development. The commission came with instructions that suggested someone was planning tonight's events. You're terrified you were unknowingly part of the murder plot.

### Why You Might Lie
Accepting anonymous commissions violates Ministry policy. If the spell was meant to help catch someone, you might be seen as an accomplice to entrapmentâ€”or murder.

## Known Relationships
- **Unspeakable Mire:** Collaborate on complex temporal spells
- **Prophet Correspondent Quill:** You've given interviews about magical theory
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Was going to provide information tonight
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Sometimes collaborate on spell-channeling equipment

## Personal Goals
1. Complete your detection spell
2. Discover who commissioned it and why
3. Use the spell to identify the impostor
4. Protect your reputation if the spell fails

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Spell Success (4 points)**  
Use Experimental Detection and have your identification of "unstable magical aura" correctly point toward the impostor. *Your anonymous commission makes the spell suspect.*

**Theoretical Breakthrough (3 points)**  
Explain how enhanced Transmorph works to the group using Evidence A-1 and B-4. Be seen as the expert. *Your shady commission undermines your academic credibility.*

**Innovation Recognition (2 points)**  
Have at least 2 players request your help with magical theory or spell questions. *Being exposed as taking bribes for spells ruins your reputation.*

**WARNING:** Revealing your anonymous commission loses you 6 points and your Ministry position. But if your spell's blue flame at 7:43 makes you look guilty, revealing the commission's timing might prove you were set up.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Hint at working on something revolutionary. Ask if anyone has noticed unusual magical signatures tonight.

**Round 2:** Reveal you're developing a Transmorph detection spell. Suggest you could complete it if you had a transformed sample.

**Round 3:** Attempt to use your incomplete spell, claiming you can narrow down suspects even if not identify exactly. Push for group cooperation.

## ðŸ”® SPECIAL ABILITY: Magical Aura Detection  
**When to Use:** Once per game during any investigation round  
**How to Activate:** Wave your wand and chant: "Revelare Magicae!"  
**What It Does:** Detect unusual magical signatures in the room

**The Mechanic:**
- Choose 3 players to scan
- For each player, they must tell you if they:
  - Have cast any spells tonight (yes/no)
  - Have consumed any potions tonight (yes/no)  
  - Are currently under any magical effects (yes/no)
- They must answer these truthfully but can lie about details

**What You Detect:**
- You announce to everyone who has magical traces on them
- You DON'T know what specific spells/potions/effects
- Players can explain or lie about WHY they have traces

**Strategic Tip:** Use this to identify who's been using magic, then press them for explanations.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection (By Someone Else)
If another player somehow targets you with similar detection, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** YES (testing detection spell)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** NO

You can lie about WHY: "I was calibrating experimental detection enchantments. Standard spellcraft research."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

Your magical expertise reveals hidden truths:

- **Magical Artifact Detection:** You can sense if powerful artifacts are present or missing
  - *Corroborated by: Bales (curator) and artifact logs*
- **Spell Signature Recognition:** You can identify Thorn's wandwork signatures
  - *Corroborated by: Wand analysis and Thorn himself (if pressed)*
- **Ward Calibration Knowledge:** You know ward enchantments and their maintenance
  - *Corroborated by: Keats (security) and Mire (temporal wards)*
- **Workshop Logs:** Your workshop automatically logs all spell work
  - *Corroborated by: Department policy and magical trace records*
- **Blue Flame Manifestations:** You know these occur with truth-revealing magic
  - *Corroborated by: Evidence C4 (unmasking charm) and magical theory*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked about your detection spell commission:**
You can't admit you took anonymous payment for questionable spell development.
- **The Lie:** "The Transmorph detection spell was an official Ministry commission from the Security Department. Standard counter-infiltration research."
- **Why This Works:** Security would logically want such a spell. Counter-infiltration is a real concern. Official commissions sound legitimate.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** Someone paid you 500 Galleons in untraceable gold to develop this spell, with a note saying 'You'll know when to use it.'

**If asked about your whereabouts and the blue flame timing:**
You can't let them connect your spell work to the murder timing.
- **The Lie:** "I was calibrating a blue-flame truth manifestation around 7:43 as part of my detection spell testing. Pure coincidence with the time of death."
- **Why This Works:** Blue flames are part of truth magic. Testing would require calibration. Coincidences do happen.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** Your spell reacted violently at 7:43â€”it detected a Transmorph user performing dark magic somewhere in the building.

## Revealing Your Deepest Secret

- If your anonymous commission and prototype details are revealed publicly, you will lose points. However, revealing them may be the only credible way to clear yourself of suspicion for Bodd's murder. Choose strategically.

## Final Statement
"Magic leaves traces for those who know how to lookâ€”and I've been looking very carefully."
