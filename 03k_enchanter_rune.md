# Enchanter Vexa Rune
*Experimental Spellcraft Division*

## Public Background
You develop new spells and modify existing ones for Ministry use. Your brilliant but unconventional approach has led to both breakthroughs and spectacular failures.

## Private Information
You've been secretly developing a spell to detect Transmorph Potion users—a commission from someone who contacted you anonymously with significant payment. The spell is almost complete but requires a rare component: essence from someone currently transformed. You had arranged to meet Bodd tonight because he claimed to have information about unauthorized Transmorph use. You were in your workshop testing the detection spell when the alarm sounded.

## Known Relationships
- **Unspeakable Mire:** Collaborate on complex temporal spells
- **Prophet Correspondent Quill:** You've given interviews about magical theory
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Was going to provide information tonight
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Sometimes collaborate on spell-channeling equipment

## Personal Goals
1. Complete your detection spell
2. Discover who commissioned it and why
3. Use the spell to identify the impostor
4. Protect your reputation if the spell fails

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Hint at working on something revolutionary. Ask if anyone has noticed unusual magical signatures tonight.

**Round 2:** Reveal you're developing a Transmorph detection spell. Suggest you could complete it if you had a transformed sample.

**Round 3:** Attempt to use your incomplete spell, claiming you can narrow down suspects even if not identify exactly. Push for group cooperation.

## Optional Spell Card
**Experimental Detection:** Once per game, wave your wand at the group and claim your spell reveals "someone here has an unstable magical aura." Create suspicion without identifying anyone specific.

## Final Statement
"Magic leaves traces for those who know how to look—and I've been looking very carefully."
