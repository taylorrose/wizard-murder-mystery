## The Unmasking

### After "Verum Revelare" is spoken:

**[READ ALOUD - Dramatic revelation voice]**

> "The blue light intensifies, swirling around the circle like a living thing. It hesitates, testing each of you, before suddenly converging on one figure. Agent Merin Vale staggers backward as the light engulfs them.
>
> Their features ripple like water. The confident posture wavers. For a moment, two faces occupy the same space—one familiar, one unknown. Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the disguise fails.
>
> Standing before you is not Merin Vale, but someone else entirely. Younger, marked by years of hardship, eyes burning with purpose.
>
> 'My name,' they say, voice no longer Vale's smooth tone, 'is Rowan Kett. And yes—I killed Alaric Bodd. But not for the reasons you think.'"

**[HOST ACTION: Let the revelation sink in. Allow immediate reactions]**

### The Confession

**[Have the player who was Vale/Kett read this, or read it yourself]**

> "Five years ago, I was a junior researcher here, working in the Hall of Enigmas. I discovered something terrible—evidence that the previous Minister, Cordelia Blackthorne, was murdered. Not disappeared. Murdered. By someone in this very room.
>
> When I tried to report it, I was dismissed, obliviated, and cast out. But obliviation isn't perfect. Fragments remained. I spent five years rebuilding my memories, planning my return.
>
> I came here tonight to expose Blackthorne's killer, using the Transmorph Potion to infiltrate as Vale. But Bodd discovered my identity through his memory research. He was going to expose me before I could complete my mission. So yes, I paralyzed him. I silenced him. And when he still tried to call for help... I ended him.
>
> I'm not proud of it. But sometimes justice requires terrible choices."

**[PAUSE for player reactions]**

### The Second Revelation

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "Rowan's words hang in the air. But even as you process this confession, something else becomes clear. The evidence points to another truth. Who had the most to gain from Minister Blackthorne's death? Who authorized the very Transmorph Potion used tonight? Who has been desperately covering their tracks?
>
> All eyes turn to Minister Odran Pyke.
>
> Commander Keats steps forward, her expression grim. 'Minister Pyke, the security logs I've been investigating... they show your access codes in Blackthorne's office the night she disappeared. You were the last to see her alive.'"

**[Allow Pyke's player to respond—they can confess, deny, or deflect]**

### The Truth

**[READ ALOUD after Pyke responds]**

> "The full truth emerges like a poison finally drawn from a wound:
>
> Minister Pyke did indeed murder Cordelia Blackthorne six months ago, staging her disappearance when she discovered Pyke's embezzlement of Ministry funds and abuse of power. Pyke used their authority to destroy evidence and silence witnesses.
>
> Rowan Kett, one of those silenced witnesses, returned for revenge but found Alaric Bodd standing in the way. In trying to expose one murder, Rowan committed another.
>
> Two killers stand before you. One who killed for power and greed. One who killed for justice and revenge. Neither innocent. Both guilty."

## Resolution Branches

**[Let the group briefly discuss which resolution they prefer, then read the appropriate ending]**

### Branch 1: Justice Served

**[If the group chooses lawful resolution]**

> "Commander Keats steps forward, wand raised. 'By the authority of the Auror Office, I arrest you both. Odran Pyke, for the murder of Minister Cordelia Blackthorne and conspiracy to conceal evidence. Rowan Kett, for the murder of Alaric Bodd and infiltration of the Ministry using illegal means.'
>
> The Ministry's wards recognize the lawful arrest. The doors unseal with a grinding sound. Within minutes, additional Aurors arrive to take both prisoners into custody.
>
> As they're led away, Rowan calls out: 'I regret killing Bodd. But I don't regret exposing the truth. The Ministry was built on lies—maybe now it can be rebuilt on justice.'
>
> The long night ends with two killers facing trial, and the Ministry facing a reckoning with its own corruption."

### Branch 2: Tragic Mercy

**[If the group chooses emotional resolution]**

> "A heavy silence falls. Finally, Inquisitor March speaks: 'We have a choice. Two lives are already lost. Must we destroy two more?'
>
> After heated debate, an unprecedented decision is reached. Pyke will quietly resign, claiming health issues, and leave the country permanently. Rowan will be obliviated—properly this time—and given a new identity far from here, their quest for vengeance finally ended.
>
> Commander Keats protests but is overruled. 'This isn't justice,' she says.
>
> 'No,' agrees Curator Bales sadly. 'But perhaps it's mercy. And after tonight, we could all use some of that.'
>
> The official record will show that Alaric Bodd died in a tragic accident. The truth dies with those who witnessed it tonight, another secret buried in the Ministry's foundations."

### Branch 3: Arcane Echo

**[If the group chooses mystical resolution]**

> "Unspeakable Mire steps forward, trembling. 'There's something you all need to know. My temporal research with Bodd... we didn't just extract memories. We created temporal echoes—copies of consciousness that exist outside time.'
>
> They pull out a shimmering crystal. 'Bodd knew he might die. He preserved an echo of himself. And... I've detected another echo. Minister Blackthorne. She's been trying to communicate from beyond.'
>
> The crystal pulses, and two translucent figures materialize—Alaric Bodd and Cordelia Blackthorne, victims united in death.
>
> 'We do not seek vengeance,' Blackthorne's echo speaks. 'We seek truth. Let our deaths serve a purpose. Reform the Ministry. End the culture of secrets that enabled our murders.'
>
> The echoes fade, leaving behind a mandate for change. Pyke is arrested, but Rowan is offered a chance: serve the Ministry's reformation as penance for their crime. Under a new identity—their third—they will help build a better institution.
>
> Some justice. Some mercy. Some hope. And in the Hall of Enigmas, two crystals glow with the preserved wisdom of the dead, ensuring such crimes can never be hidden again."

## Epilogue: The Mirror's Secret

**[READ ALOUD regardless of chosen branch]**

> "One month later...
>
> The new Minister (whether Keats, March, or another) orders a full inventory of the Hall of Artifacts. The Mirror of Masks is recovered from a hidden room, but something is wrong.
>
> The Mirror shows a face no one recognizes—neither Vale nor Kett, neither Pyke nor Bodd. Someone else entirely. Someone who was never supposed to be there that night.
>
> Below the reflection, words appear in the glass: 'The third shadow watches still.'
>
> Curator Bales, examining the Mirror, goes pale. 'This is impossible. The Mirror only shows people who have touched it. But according to this... there was someone else in the Ministry that night. Someone we never detected.'
>
> The investigation may be closed, but the mystery, it seems, has just begun.
>
> [TO BE CONTINUED...]"

## Final Host Notes

### Managing the Reveal
1. Let the initial revelation breathe—don't rush
2. Allow Kett's player to deliver their confession with feeling
3. Give Pyke's player a moment to respond to accusations
4. If players are confused, clarify the dual-killer situation
5. Let the group genuinely debate the resolution

### If Players Guessed Early
- Still play out the reveal dramatically
- Emphasize the "why" over the "who"
- Focus on the moral complexities
- Let correct guessers feel vindicated

### Sequel Teasing
The epilogue sets up "The Third Shadow" mystery. If players want to play again:
- The unknown face in the Mirror could be anyone
- Perhaps someone used the temporal research to hide outside time
- The previous Minister's death might have had another witness
- Vale (the real one) never appeared—where are they?
