## The Unmasking

### After "Verum Revelare" is spoken:

**[READ ALOUD - Dramatic revelation voice]**

> "The blue light intensifies, swirling around the circle like a living thing. It hesitates, testing each of you, before suddenly converging on one figure. Agent Soren Blackwood staggers backward as the light engulfs them.
>
> Their features ripple like water. The confident posture wavers. For a moment, two faces occupy the same space—one familiar, one unknown. Then, with a sound like shattering glass, the disguise fails.
>
> Standing before you is not Soren Blackwood, but someone else entirely. Younger, marked by years of hardship, eyes burning with purpose.
>
> 'My name,' they say, voice no longer Blackwood's smooth tone, 'is Morgan Cross. And yes—I killed Alaric Bodd. But not for the reasons you think.'"

**[HOST ACTION: Let the revelation sink in. Allow immediate reactions]**

### The Confession

**[Have the player who was Blackwood/Cross read this, or read it yourself]**

> "Five years ago, I was a junior researcher here, working in the Hall of Enigmas. I discovered something terrible—evidence that the previous Minister, Cordelia Blackthorne, was murdered. Not disappeared. Murdered. By someone in this very room.
>
> When I tried to report it, I was dismissed, obliviated, and cast out. But obliviation isn't perfect. Fragments remained. I spent five years rebuilding my memories, planning my return.
>
> I came here tonight to expose Blackthorne's killer, using the Transmorph Potion to infiltrate as Blackwood. But Bodd discovered my identity through his memory research. He was going to expose me before I could complete my mission. So yes, I paralyzed him. I silenced him. And when he still tried to call for help... I ended him.
>
> I'm not proud of it. But sometimes justice requires terrible choices."

**[PAUSE for player reactions]**

### The Second Revelation

**[READ ALOUD]**

> "Rowan's words hang in the air. But even as you process this confession, something else becomes clear. Who had the most to gain from Minister Blackthorne's death? Who authorized the very Transmorph Potion used tonight? Who has been desperately covering their tracks?
>
> All eyes turn to Minister Aldric Thorne.
>
> Commander Keats steps forward, her expression grim. 'Minister Thorne, the security logs I've been investigating... they show your access codes in Blackthorne's office the night she disappeared. You were the last to see her alive.'"

**[Allow Thorne's player to respond—they can confess, deny, or deflect]**

### The Full Truth

**[READ ALOUD after Thorne responds]**

> "The full truth emerges like a poison finally drawn from a wound:
>
> Minister Thorne did indeed murder Cordelia Blackthorne six months ago, staging her disappearance when she discovered Thorne's embezzlement of Ministry funds and abuse of power. Thorne used their authority to destroy evidence and silence witnesses.
>
> Morgan Cross, one of those silenced witnesses, returned for justice—yet found Alaric Bodd standing in the way. In trying to expose one murder, Morgan committed another.
>
> Two killers stand before you. One who killed for power and greed. One who killed for justice and revenge. Neither innocent. Both guilty."

## Resolution Branches

**[Let the group briefly discuss which resolution they prefer, then read the appropriate ending]**

### Branch 1: Justice Served (Lawful)

> "Commander Keats steps forward, wand raised. 'By the authority of the Auror Office, I arrest you both. Aldric Thorne, for the murder of Minister Cordelia Blackthorne and conspiracy to conceal evidence. Morgan Cross, for the murder of Alaric Bodd and infiltration of the Ministry using illegal means.'
>
> The Ministry's wards recognize the lawful arrest. The doors unseal with a grinding sound. Within minutes, additional Aurors arrive to take both prisoners into custody.
>
> As they're led away, Rowan calls out: 'I regret killing Bodd. But I don't regret exposing the truth. The Ministry was built on lies—maybe now it can be rebuilt on justice.'"

### Branch 2: Tragic Mercy (Emotional)

> "A heavy silence falls. Finally, Inquisitor March speaks: 'We have a choice. Two lives are already lost. Must we destroy two more?'
>
> After heated debate, an unprecedented decision is reached. Thorne will quietly resign, claiming health issues, and leave the country permanently. Morgan will be obliviated—properly this time—and given a new identity far from here, their quest for vengeance finally ended.
>
> Commander Keats protests but is overruled. 'This isn't justice,' she says.
>
> 'No,' agrees Curator Bales sadly. 'But perhaps it's mercy.'"

### Branch 3: Arcane Echo (Mystical)

> "Unspeakable Mire steps forward, trembling. 'My temporal research with Bodd preserved echoes of consciousness.'
>
> Two translucent figures materialize—Alaric Bodd and Cordelia Blackthorne. 'We do not seek vengeance,' Blackthorne's echo speaks. 'We seek truth. Reform the Ministry.'
>
> Thorne is arrested; Morgan is offered penance—serve the reformation under a new identity. Some justice. Some mercy. Some hope."

## Epilogue: The Mirror's Secret

**[READ ALOUD regardless of chosen branch]**

> "One month later... The new Minister orders a full inventory. The Mirror of Masks is recovered, but it shows a face no one recognizes—neither Blackwood nor Cross, neither Thorne nor Bodd. Someone else entirely.
>
> Words appear in the glass: 'The third shadow watches still.'
>
> Bales whispers, 'Impossible. The Mirror only shows those who touched it.' The investigation may be closed, but the mystery has only deepened."
