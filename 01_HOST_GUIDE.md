## IMPORTANT: This Guide is SPOILER-FREE
This guide allows you, the host, to participate as a character while running the game. The identity of the murderer and impostor are sealed in the REVEAL_EPILOGUE document. Do not read that file until the scripted reveal moment.

## Quick Overview
**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Players:** 9-12 (scaling guide included)  
**Setting:** The Ministry of Wonders, after-hours lockdown  
**Core Mystery:** Senior Unspeakable Alaric Bodd has been murdered. One among you is not who they claim to be.

## ðŸŽ­ NEW: Portrait Narration Option
For an easier hosting experience, use the **Portrait Scripts** (Document 00). Three magical portraits guide the entire game through pre-written scripts or audio recordings. The host simply follows their instructions, distributing materials and tracking votes when prompted. This option:
- Reduces host memorization to zero
- Adds entertaining character interactions
- Provides built-in timing and pacing
- Works as audio recordings OR read-aloud scripts

### 60-Second Rules (Read Aloud)
> "Welcome! Here's how tonight works:
> - We're here to identify the impostor and the murderer by the final vote.
> - Three rounds; I'll reveal new evidence each round. You can lie about story, never about mechanics.
> - One quick suspicion check happens at the end of Round 2. Then final statements and the vote.
> - Non-verbal play is fine; say 'pause' anytime you need a moment.
> 
> Remember: Points are tracked secretly. Focus on the story and investigation."

### Starter Questions (Say this out loud after character reading)
> "Not sure where to start? Try these:
> - 'Where were you between 7:30 and 7:45?'
> - 'What's one thing you know that most people here don't?'
> - 'Who could access the Hall of Enigmas tonight?'"

## Narrator Instructions

### Portrait Option (RECOMMENDED)
Use Document 00 (PORTRAIT_SCRIPTS) for a fully guided experience. The three portrait characters handle all narration, letting you focus on logistics or even play a character yourself. Simply follow their scripted instructions.

### Traditional Narrator Role
If not using portraits, you may choose a character to play while hosting. Select one with moderate involvement (recommended: Archivist Nella Vane or Curator Theon Bales). During narration moments:
1. Step slightly out of character
2. Use a different voice/posture for narration
3. Return to character after reading
4. Your character knowledge remains separate from narrator knowledge

### Script Cues
The ROUND_SCRIPTS document uses these markers:
- **[READ ALOUD]** - Narration to be spoken
- **[DISTRIBUTE EVIDENCE X]** - Hand out evidence
- **[TIMER: X MIN]** - Set timer
- **[HOST ACTION]** - Physical direction for you
- **[OPTIONAL]** - Can be skipped for pacing

## Safety & Accessibility

### Consent Tools
Implement at least one:
- **X-Card System:** Place an X card on the table. Anyone can tap it to pause and adjust content
- **Pause Rule:** Anyone can say "pause" to take a break
- **Check-ins:** Brief mood checks between rounds

### Content Considerations
- No real substances (drinks are props only)
- No physical contact required
- Players may participate non-verbally
- Large-print versions available on request

### Accessibility Options
- Provide character summaries in sans-serif font
- Allow digital note-taking
- Buddy system for vision-impaired players
- Quiet space available for overwhelmed players
- **Large-print sheets available** - high-contrast fonts/colors used throughout
- **Seated play and note-passing** are welcome alternatives to speaking
