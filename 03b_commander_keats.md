# Auror Commander Brina Keats
*Head of Magical Law Enforcement*

## Public Background
You are the decorated head of the Auror Office, known for your methodical investigation style and unshakeable loyalty to the Ministry. You've served for fifteen years, rising through the ranks after solving the Goblin Vault conspiracy.

## Private Information
You discovered irregularities in the security logs three days agoâ€”someone has been accessing restricted areas using high-level clearance codes. You suspect corruption at the highest levels but haven't reported it yet because the access codes belonged to the Minister. You were investigating these breaches in the security office when Bodd died. Additionally, you've been secretly investigating the previous Minister's disappearance, believing it wasn't voluntary.

## Known Relationships
- **Minister Pyke:** Your direct superior, whom you're beginning to doubt
- **Agent Vale:** One of your special operations contacts, though something seems off about them lately
- **Healer Dredge:** Worked together on several cases involving magical maladies
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** He recently requested Auror protection but wouldn't say why

## Personal Goals
1. Uncover the truth about the security breaches
2. Determine if Ministry leadership is compromised  
3. Identify the impostor before they can escape
4. Protect the innocent while maintaining order

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Question everyone about their movements tonight. Take charge of organizing information without revealing your suspicions about the Minister.

**Round 2:** When evidence points to inside knowledge, press those with high clearance. Share concerns about security breaches but not who they implicate.

**Round 3:** If the Minister seems guilty, you must choose between duty and justice. Consider revealing what you know about the previous Minister's disappearance.

## Optional Spell Card
**Auror's Insight:** Twice per game, after someone makes a statement, you may announce "That contradicts evidence I've found." They must either admit to lying or provide more detail.

## Final Statement
"In fifteen years of service, I've never seen deception run this deep."
