# Auror Commander Brina Keats
*Head of Magical Law Enforcement*

## Public Background
You are the decorated head of the Auror Office, known for your methodical investigation style and unshakeable loyalty to the Ministry. You've served for fifteen years, rising through the ranks after solving the Goblin Vault conspiracy.

## Private Information
You discovered irregularities in the security logs three days agoâ€”someone has been accessing restricted areas using high-level clearance codes. You suspect corruption at the highest levels but haven't reported it yet because the access codes belonged to the Minister. You were investigating these breaches in the security office when Bodd died. Additionally, you've been secretly investigating the previous Minister's disappearance, believing it wasn't voluntary.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
Security Division ops room auditing breach reports and preparing protection detail. Not in Hall during time of death. You have documentation proving your location.

### Why You Might Lie
Protecting your ongoing investigation; don't want to tip off whoever is using Minister's codes. The corruption goes deeper than anyone knows.

## Known Relationships
- **Minister Thorne:** Your direct superior, whom you're beginning to doubt
- **Agent Blackwood:** One of your special operations contacts, though something seems off about them lately
- **Healer Dredge:** Worked together on several cases involving magical maladies
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** He recently requested Auror protection but wouldn't say why

## Personal Goals
1. Uncover the truth about the security breaches
2. Determine if Ministry leadership is compromised
3. Identify the impostor before they can escape
4. Protect the innocent while maintaining order

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Security Excellence (4 points)**  
Identify and publicly state three actual security breaches that occurred (based on evidence). All three must be confirmed as accurate. *Revealing your unauthorized investigation of the Minister could compromise this objective.*

**Leadership Recognition (3 points)**  
Have at least 3 players follow your suggested investigation method or questioning order. *Admitting you've been secretly investigating your superior undermines your leadership credibility.*

**Threat Neutralized (2 points)**  
Be part of the group that correctly identifies either the impostor OR murderer. *Focus on solving the case, not clearing yourself.*

**WARNING:** Revealing your secret investigation loses you 3 points. But if strongly suspected, revealing it might be necessary to prove you're not the murderer.

**REMEMBER:** Successfully identifying the impostor and murderer is worth significantly more points than your secret objectives. But only if the group succeeds. Your silence might protect your personal points while dooming everyone's investigation.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Question everyone about their movements tonight. Take charge of organizing information without revealing your suspicions about the Minister.

**Round 2:** When evidence points to inside knowledge, press those with high clearance. Share concerns about security breaches but not who they implicate.

**Round 3:** If the Minister seems guilty, you must choose between duty and justice. Consider revealing what you know about the previous Minister's disappearance.

## ðŸ”® SPECIAL ABILITY: Security Protocol
**When to Use:** Twice per game during any investigation round  
**How to Activate:** Stand and announce: "Security Protocol - Containment Check!"  
**What It Does:** Force someone to stay in character while you interrogate them

**The Mechanic:**
1. Choose one player - they must stand
2. Ask them 3 rapid-fire questions about their whereabouts
3. They have 5 seconds to answer each question
4. No time to think of elaborate lies
5. The group judges if their quick answers match their earlier claims

**Example Questions:**
- "Which door did you enter through?"
- "Who did you pass in the hallway?"  
- "What spell did you cast?"
- "What time did you arrive?"

**Rules:**
- Questions must be about physical facts
- Player must answer immediately (count to 5)
- Can't repeat earlier questions

**Strategic Tip:** Use this on someone whose story seems rehearsed. Quick questions reveal inconsistencies.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** YES (security ward calibrations)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** NO

You can lie about WHY: "Security protocols require constant ward maintenance and detection charm updates. Standard procedure."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

You have security knowledge that others don't know you possess:

- **Decoy Sweep Schedule:** Decoy sweeps only run on Tuesdays (this is Sunday)
  - *Corroborated by: Blackwood (special ops would know) and March (investigates security protocols)*
- **Auror Training Tonight:** All junior aurors had mandatory training until 8 PM
  - *Corroborated by: Blackwood (coordinates with your department) and Thorne (approved the training)*
- **Ward Calibration Logs:** Ward calibrations auto-log to the main system
  - *Corroborated by: Mire (temporal ward specialist) and Rune (ward enchantment expert)*
- **Level 5 Clearance List:** You know exactly who has Level 5 clearance (only 6 people)
  - *Corroborated by: Thorne (grants clearance) and Vane (maintains clearance records)*
- **Ministry Alarms:** You know temporal ripples would trigger Ministry-wide alerts
  - *Corroborated by: Mire (temporal specialist) and your security logs*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked for specific details about what you were doing in the Security Division:**
You can't reveal you were investigating Minister Thorne's suspicious use of clearance codes.
- **The Lie:** "I was meeting with a junior auror between 7:32 and 7:38 about tomorrow's patrol schedules."
- **Why This Works:** As head of Law Enforcement, you regularly meet with junior staff. Patrol schedules are routine, boring work that no one would question. You can't name the specific auror due to 'ongoing security operations.'
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were actually reviewing logs showing Thorne's access codes being used at suspicious times, possibly related to Blackthorne's disappearance.

**If asked why you weren't immediately at the crime scene when the alarm sounded:**
You can't admit you were deep in classified files investigating your own superior.
- **The Lie:** "I was performing a scheduled ward calibration test at 7:40. These tests temporarily disable local alarms in the testing area, which explains why I was a minute late responding."
- **Why This Works:** Ward calibrations are routine security maintenance. They do interfere with magical detection systems. As Security Chief, you would personally oversee sensitive calibrations.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were so absorbed in discovering evidence of high-level corruption that you almost missed the alarm entirely.

## Revealing Your Deepest Secret

- If your deepest investigative secret is revealed publicly, you will lose points. However, revealing it may be the only credible way to clear yourself of suspicion for Bodd's murder. Choose strategically.

## Final Statement
"In fifteen years of service, I've never seen deception run this deep."
