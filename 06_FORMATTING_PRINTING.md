## Creating the Parchment Effect

### Method 1: Tea/Coffee Aging (Recommended)
1. **Brew strong tea or coffee** (3-4 bags/scoops per cup)
2. **Let cool to room temperature**
3. **Before printing:** Lightly brush paper with tea/coffee
4. **Let dry completely** (use hair dryer for speed)
5. **Print normally** once fully dry
6. **Optional:** Crumple lightly and smooth for texture

### Method 2: Digital Aging
1. **Choose cream/beige paper** for printing
2. **Adjust printer settings:**
   - Reduce black intensity to 85-90%
   - Add slight sepia tone if available
3. **Print borders:** Add subtle torn-edge effects

### Method 3: Hybrid Approach
1. **Print on cream paper first**
2. **Lightly dab edges** with tea/coffee using sponge
3. **Optional:** Burn edges VERY carefully (safety first!)
4. **Add coffee ring stains** for evidence items

## Print Testing Guide

### Test Page Content
Before printing everything, test with:
1. One character dossier
2. One evidence card
3. Check: readability, cut lines align, aging effects work

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Problem: Text too light after aging**
- Solution: Increase printer darkness setting to 110-120%

**Problem: Paper jams with thick stock**
- Solution: Use manual feed tray, print smaller batches

**Problem: Cuts aren't straight**
- Solution: Use ruler and craft knife instead of scissors

**Problem: Aging makes paper wrinkle**
- Solution: Iron on low heat between parchment paper
