*A Wizard-World Mystery (Parody Edition)*

---

## Welcome, Investigator

You have been summoned to the Ministry of Wonders for an emergency meeting. What began as routine has become deadly. A murder has been committed, the building is sealed by ancient magic, and worst of all—one among you is not who they claim to be.

## Your Mission

**Primary Objectives:**
1. **Identify the Impostor** - Someone is using Transmorph Potion to wear a false face
2. **Identify the Murderer** - Someone killed Alaric Bodd, Senior Unspeakable
3. **Survive the Night** - Trust carefully, anyone could be the enemy

These may be the same person or different people. Evidence will guide you, but deduction and instinct must prevail.
