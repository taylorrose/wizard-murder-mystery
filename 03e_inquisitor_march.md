# Inquisitor Selwyn March
*Department of Magical Law - Integrity Division*

## Public Background
You investigate corruption and misconduct within the Ministry itself. Your reputation for ruthless pursuit of truth makes you both respected and feared.

## Private Information
You've been building a case against Minister Pyke for abuse of power, including unauthorized use of restricted potions. Bodd was going to be your key witness—he had promised to testify about Pyke's pressure to suppress his research. You were in Bodd's office earlier today, planning his testimony, and noticed he seemed terrified of something beyond just Pyke. You have a recording crystal with Bodd's voice saying "The Minister is not the Minister" but you don't understand what he meant.

## Known Relationships
- **Minister Pyke:** Your primary investigation target
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Your would-be star witness
- **Prophet Correspondent Quill:** They've been trying to get information about your investigations
- **Curator Bales:** You suspect they got their position through nepotism

## Personal Goals
1. Continue your investigation despite losing your witness
2. Determine if Bodd's death relates to your case
3. Understand Bodd's cryptic warning about the Minister
4. Expose corruption even if it reaches the highest levels

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Probe the Minister's activities without revealing your investigation. Ask pointed questions about who benefits from Bodd's death.

**Round 2:** Share Bodd's cryptic message about the Minister. Press those with connections to Pyke about their loyalty.

**Round 3:** Reveal the full scope of your investigation. Demand answers about the Transmorph authorization and suggest the Minister might be the impostor.

## Optional Spell Card
**Truth Compulsion:** Once per game, declare "Under ministerial law, I compel truth!" The next statement by target player must be partially true (they choose what part).

## Final Statement
"Corruption spreads like poison—and tonight, we see its deadly fruit."
