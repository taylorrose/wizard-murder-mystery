# Inquisitor Selwyn March
*Department of Magical Law - Integrity Division*

## Public Background
You investigate corruption and misconduct within the Ministry itself. Your reputation for ruthless pursuit of truth makes you both respected and feared.

## Private Information
You've been building a case against Minister Thorne for abuse of power, including unauthorized use of restricted potions. Bodd was going to be your key witnessâ€”he had promised to testify about Thorne's pressure to suppress his research. You were in Bodd's office earlier today, planning his testimony, and noticed he seemed terrified of something beyond just Thorne. You have a recording crystal with Bodd's voice saying "The Minister is not the Minister" but you don't understand what he meant.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
In your office drafting corruption charges against Thorne. You have timestamped documents to prove it.

### What You're Hiding
You've been building an unauthorized case against the Minister without proper warrants. If exposed, you could face charges yourself for overreach.

### Why You Might Lie
You can't reveal the full scope of your investigationâ€”it could warn corrupt officials and endanger other witnesses.

## Known Relationships
- **Minister Thorne:** Your primary investigation target
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Your would-be star witness
- **Prophet Correspondent Quill:** They've been trying to get information about your investigations
- **Curator Bales:** You suspect they got their position through nepotism

## Personal Goals
1. Continue your investigation despite losing your witness
2. Determine if Bodd's death relates to your case
3. Understand Bodd's cryptic warning about the Minister
4. Expose corruption even if it reaches the highest levels

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Relentless Pursuit (4 points)**  
Force at least 2 players to admit to lying using your Truth Compulsion or aggressive questioning. *Revealing your unauthorized investigation weakens your moral authority.*

**Corruption Exposed (3 points)**  
Get someone to admit to a crime or serious misconduct (not necessarily the murder). *Your own procedural violations undermine this if exposed.*

**Case Builder (2 points)**  
Present a coherent theory connecting at least 3 pieces of evidence by Round 3. *Admitting Bodd was your secret witness complicates your narrative.*

**WARNING:** Revealing your unauthorized investigation loses you 4 points. But if suspicion mounts that you killed Bodd to silence him, revealing he was actually helping you might be necessary.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Probe the Minister's activities without revealing your investigation. Ask pointed questions about who benefits from Bodd's death.

**Round 2:** Share Bodd's cryptic message about the Minister. Press those with connections to Thorne about their loyalty.

**Round 3:** Reveal the full scope of your investigation. Demand answers about the Transmorph authorization and suggest the Minister might be the impostor.

## ðŸ”® SPECIAL ABILITY: Truth Compulsion
**When to Use:** Once per game during any investigation round  
**How to Activate:** Point at one player and declare: "By my authority, I compel truth!"  
**What It Does:** Force the target to answer ONE yes/no question truthfully

**Rules:**
- Must be a clear YES or NO question
- Cannot ask "Are you the murderer/impostor?" directly  
- CAN ask:
  - "Were you in [specific location] at [specific time]?"
  - "Have you taken any potions tonight?"
  - "Is your stated alibi completely true?"
  - "Have you lied to the group tonight?"

**The Mechanic:**
- Target must answer YES or NO truthfully to that one question
- They can still lie about everything else
- No follow-up questions allowed

**Strategic Tip:** Save this for when you need to break a specific lie or confirm a suspicion.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** YES (recording spells for evidence)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** NO

You can lie about WHY: "Documentation spells for my investigation. Recording evidence is standard Inquisitor protocol."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

Your investigative work gives you insider knowledge:

- **Official Commission Records:** You track all official spell commissionsâ€”none were filed this month
  - *Corroborated by: Ministry filing system and Rune (who would have received official commission)*
- **Security Protocol Verification:** You can verify all security protocols and procedures
  - *Corroborated by: Keats (security chief) and your investigation files*
- **Training Schedule Access:** You know about mandatory training schedules for verification
  - *Corroborated by: Your subpoenaed records and department heads*
- **Nepotism Knowledge:** You know Bales got their position through Thorne's recommendation
  - *Corroborated by: Employment records and Thorne himself (if pressed)*
- **Atrium Renovation:** You know it's been closed for two weeksâ€”you investigated the contractor
  - *Corroborated by: Posted notices and Bales (who arranged it)*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked exactly what you were doing in your office:**
You can't reveal you were drafting charges against the Minister without proper authorization.
- **The Lie:** "I was following up on a report about suspicious activity in the corridors around 7:35. I was shadowing a potential suspect."
- **Why This Works:** As an Inquisitor, shadowing suspects is part of your job. Vague timing makes it hard to disprove. "Potential suspect" could be anyone.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were actually writing up formal corruption charges against Thorne based on Bodd's promised testimony.

**If asked who you were planning to interview:**
You can't admit Bodd was going to testify against Thorne.
- **The Lie:** "I had scheduled an interview with a witness in the atrium about irregularities in department spending."
- **Why This Works:** Financial irregularities are common investigations. The atrium is a neutral meeting spot. Witness confidentiality prevents you from naming names.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** Bodd was your star witness against Thorne, and now he's deadâ€”possibly to silence him.

## Revealing Your Deepest Secret

- If your deepest investigative secret is revealed publicly, you will lose points. However, revealing it may be the only credible way to clear yourself of suspicion for Bodd's murder. Choose strategically.

## Final Statement
"Corruption spreads like poisonâ€”and tonight, we see its deadly fruit."
