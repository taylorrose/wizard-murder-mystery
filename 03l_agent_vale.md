# Agent Merin Vale
*Special Operations Liaison*

## Public Background
You are a Special Operations Liaison, handling sensitive missions between the Auror Office and other departments. Your record shows five years of exemplary service with numerous commendations for undercover work.

## Private Information
Your public record is impeccable—perhaps too impeccable. You've been involved in several high-profile cases that brought you into contact with most Ministry departments. You were supposedly meeting with Bodd about a security matter when he was discovered dead, though you arrived moments after the alarm sounded. You have detailed knowledge of Ministry procedures that sometimes surprises even veteran employees.

## Known Relationships
- **Commander Keats:** Your supposed superior in special operations
- **Archivist Vane:** Has been researching your background
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Were scheduled to meet tonight
- **Minister Pyke:** You've briefed them on several operations

## Personal Goals
1. Maintain your cover identity
2. Complete your mission (whatever that might be)
3. Avoid detection by those investigating
4. Adapt to unexpected circumstances

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Be helpful but not too knowledgeable. Support the investigation while deflecting personal questions. Establish you just arrived.

**Round 2:** When your missing records are mentioned, have a plausible explanation ready (classified operations, witness protection, etc.).

**Round 3:** If pressured, lean into being mysterious but not necessarily guilty. Perhaps you're investigating something yourself?

## Optional Spell Card
**Field Training:** Once per game, you may demonstrate surprising knowledge about any Ministry department or procedure, claiming "special operations training."

## Final Statement
"In my line of work, nothing is ever quite what it seems."

## DO NOT OPEN UNTIL DIRECTED

## YOUR TRUE IDENTITY: Rowan Kett

You are not Merin Vale. The real Agent Vale is unconscious in a safe house, kept alive to maintain the Transmorph connection. You are Rowan Kett, a former Ministry employee who was wrongfully dismissed and obliviated five years ago for discovering corruption.

You've spent years planning this infiltration to expose the truth about the previous Minister's disappearance—they were murdered by someone currently in this room who then covered it up. Alaric Bodd had discovered your true identity through his memory research and was going to expose you tonight, forcing you to act.

### The Transmorph Potion
You took an enhanced version ninety minutes ago using Metamorphmagus hair, giving you about 3-4 hours total. By Round 3, you'll start showing signs of reversion—occasional flickers, moments of forgetting Vale's mannerisms, etc.

### Your Mission
You came here to gather evidence about the previous Minister's murder, not to kill anyone. But Bodd's discovery forced your hand. You used a modified wand (purchased from someone in this room under your real name) to paralyze him, then staged the scene to look like multiple suspects could be guilty.

### What You Know
- Minister Pyke authorized the Transmorph that was "stolen" (you stole it)
- Commander Keats is investigating the previous Minister's disappearance  
- The Curator's Mirror of Masks could have helped you but was already missing
- Someone else here is also hiding a major secret about that night

### Critical Information
You don't know who killed the previous Minister, only that it was someone now present. You're trying to force them to reveal themselves while avoiding your own exposure.

### Behavioral Cues
- **Round 1:** Perfect impersonation
- **Round 2:** Occasional hesitation on personal details about Vale
- **Round 3:** Physical flickers, forgetting names momentarily, sweating

### If Accused
You can maintain innocence until the Unmasking Charm. Your defense is that you came to expose corruption, not commit murder. The real murderer is whoever killed the previous Minister—and they're still among the group.

### The Name "R. Kett"
Yes, you purchased the modified wand from Wandwright Thorn using your real initials. This was necessary as untraceable wands require some form of identity verification, even if fake.
