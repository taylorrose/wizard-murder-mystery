# Unspeakable Dorian Mire
*Hall of Time - Temporal Research*

## Public Background
You research time magic in the Department of Mysteries' most classified division. Your work involves prophecies, time loops, and temporal paradoxes that few understand.

## Private Information
You and Bodd were working on a project involving memory extraction across temporal gapsâ€”essentially viewing memories from the future or past. The project was ordered classified by someone above Bodd, and he was growing paranoid about why. You've been experiencing temporal echoes all dayâ€”brief visions of possible futures, including one where you saw yourself dead. You were in the Time Room when Bodd died, but time moves strangely thereâ€”you could have been gone for minutes or hours.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
In the Time Room where time moves subjectively. You could have been there for 5 minutes or 5 hours from your perspective. No reliable alibi.

### What You're Hiding
The memory extraction project could revolutionize criminal investigationâ€”or be used for terrible surveillance. You and Bodd discovered something about the previous Minister's fate that someone wants buried.

### Why You Might Lie
The project is beyond classified. Also, temporal research makes you look suspiciousâ€”you could theoretically have killed Bodd and not remember due to time loops.

## Known Relationships
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Fellow Unspeakable and research partner
- **Curator Bales:** You borrow temporal artifacts from them
- **Enchanter Rune:** They help with complex spell work
- **Minister Thorne:** The one pushing for more transparency in your department

## Personal Goals
1. Protect the classified research from exposure
2. Understand why Bodd was killed
3. Determine if the temporal echoes are warning you
4. Identify who classified your joint project

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Temporal Authority (4 points)**  
Use Temporal Echo to catch someone in an inconsistency that proves important. *Revealing your classified research undermines Department of Mysteries protocols.*

**Future Warning (3 points)**  
Correctly predict something that will happen before the game ends based on your "temporal echoes." *Your unstable timeline makes you unreliable if exposed.*

**Classified Keeper (2 points)**  
Never fully explain what you and Bodd were researching. Keep the deepest secrets. *This is incompatible with clearing yourself if suspected.*

**WARNING:** Revealing your classified research loses you 5 points and violates your Unspeakable oath. But if your temporal instability makes you a prime suspect, revealing the research might be necessary.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Be vague about your whereabouts (time distortion). Mention working with Bodd but not on what. Observe who seems to know about your research.

**Round 2:** Share your temporal echoes, including seeing yourself dead. Reveal the memory extraction project but not its full implications.

**Round 3:** Suggest the murderer might have known about future memories. Reveal who classified the project if you've identified them.

## ðŸ”® SPECIAL ABILITY: Temporal Echo
**When to Use:** Once per game during any investigation round  
**How to Activate:** Touch your temple and say: "I see an echo from the past..."  
**What It Does:** Force two players to verify each other's alibis

**The Mechanic:**
1. Choose any 2 players
2. Name a specific time (between 7:00-7:47)
3. Each must say if they saw the other at that time
4. If their stories contradict, you've caught someone lying

**Rules:**
- Players must answer honestly about WHETHER they saw each other
- They can still lie about what they were doing
- Works best on people claiming to be together

**Example:**
- "Dredge and Thorn, at 7:30, did you see each other?"
- If both say yes â†’ Their alibi holds
- If one says no â†’ Someone is lying

**Strategic Tip:** Use this to test paired alibis or to verify if someone was really alone.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** YES (temporal research spells)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** YES (temporal displacement residue)

You can lie about WHY: "Temporal research leaves residual chronological displacement. It's why time moves strangely around me."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

Your temporal expertise reveals hidden truths:

- **Temporal Ward Schedules:** You know maintenance schedules for all temporal wards
  - *Corroborated by: Keats (security) and maintenance logs*
- **Time Room Alerts:** Temporal ripples would trigger Ministry-wide alarms
  - *Corroborated by: Keats (monitors alarms) and security protocols*
- **Temporal Signatures:** Time-shifted messages leave distinctive magical traces
  - *Corroborated by: Evidence examination and Rune (spell expert)*
- **Hall of Enigmas Access:** You know it was scheduled for maintenance tonight
  - *Corroborated by: Thorne (who approved it) and Bales (coordinates maintenance)*
- **Classification Authority:** Only Minister-level can classify Unspeakable projects
  - *Corroborated by: Department protocols and Thorne (if pressed)*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked about your vague whereabouts:**
You can't explain time distortion without sounding insane or guilty.
- **The Lie:** "I stepped out of the Time Room at approximately 7:36 to stabilize a temporal ripple in the corridor. These micro-rifts happen when we're doing intensive research."
- **Why This Works:** Temporal research does cause anomalies. Micro-rifts sound technical enough to be real. The specific time gives you a brief window outside the Time Room.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** Time in the Time Room is subjectiveâ€”you genuinely don't know if you were there for the whole murder window or not.

**If asked about your research with Bodd:**
You can't reveal the memory extraction project or what you discovered about Blackthorne.
- **The Lie:** "I attempted to send Bodd a warning earlier today using experimental time-shifted messaging. Perhaps it arrived too late."
- **Why This Works:** Shows you tried to help Bodd. Time-shifted messages are theoretically possible. Explains your connection without revealing the project.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You and Bodd extracted a memory showing Minister Blackthorne's final momentsâ€”and the killer's identity is somehow connected to tonight.

## Revealing Your Deepest Secret

- If your classified research details are revealed publicly, you will lose points. However, revealing them may be the only credible way to clear yourself of suspicion for Bodd's murder. Choose strategically.

## Final Statement
"Time reveals all secretsâ€”past, present, and future."
