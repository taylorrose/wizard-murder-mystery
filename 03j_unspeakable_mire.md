# Unspeakable Dorian Mire
*Hall of Time - Temporal Research*

## Public Background
You research time magic in the Department of Mysteries' most classified division. Your work involves prophecies, time loops, and temporal paradoxes that few understand.

## Private Information
You and Bodd were working on a project involving memory extraction across temporal gaps—essentially viewing memories from the future or past. The project was ordered classified by someone above Bodd, and he was growing paranoid about why. You've been experiencing temporal echoes all day—brief visions of possible futures, including one where you saw yourself dead. You were in the Time Room when Bodd died, but time moves strangely there—you could have been gone for minutes or hours.

## Known Relationships
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Fellow Unspeakable and research partner
- **Curator Bales:** You borrow temporal artifacts from them
- **Enchanter Rune:** They help with complex spell work
- **Minister Pyke:** The one pushing for more transparency in your department

## Personal Goals
1. Protect the classified research from exposure
2. Understand why Bodd was killed
3. Determine if the temporal echoes are warning you
4. Identify who classified your joint project

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Be vague about your whereabouts (time distortion). Mention working with Bodd but not on what. Observe who seems to know about your research.

**Round 2:** Share your temporal echoes, including seeing yourself dead. Reveal the memory extraction project but not its full implications.

**Round 3:** Suggest the murderer might have known about future memories. Reveal who classified the project if you've identified them.

## Optional Spell Card
**Temporal Echo:** Once per game, you may claim to have "seen a echo of this moment" and ask one player to repeat their last statement, suggesting inconsistency.

## Final Statement
"Time reveals all secrets—past, present, and future."
