# Magizoologist Elara Finn
*Department of Creature Relations*

## Public Background
You oversee the Ministry's magical creature affairs, from dragon incidents to house-elf rights. Your compassionate approach often puts you at odds with those who see creatures as tools or threats.

## Private Information
You were investigating illegal trafficking of Metamorphmagus hair—a key ingredient in enhanced Transmorph Potion that extends transformation time. Your investigation led to someone inside the Ministry, but you haven't identified who. Bodd had asked for your expertise last week about "creature-based transformation" but you thought it was academic curiosity. You were in the creature holding area feeding the messenger owls when the body was discovered.

### Where You Really Were (7:30-7:45)
In the creature holding area feeding messenger owls. The owls can vouch for you (they get agitated if feeding is late).

### What You're Hiding
You've been conducting an unauthorized investigation into creature trafficking that could implicate high-ranking officials.

### Why You Might Lie
You can't reveal the full trafficking investigation—the smuggler inside the Ministry might silence you next.

## Known Relationships
- **Healer Dredge:** Regular consultation on creature injuries
- **Curator Bales:** They sometimes acquire creature artifacts for display
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Recent unusual interest in transformation
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Their wands sometimes use rare creature components

## Personal Goals
1. Share your trafficking discovery without endangering your investigation
2. Determine if enhanced Transmorph was used tonight
3. Protect innocent creatures from being blamed
4. Identify the trafficking connection inside the Ministry

## Secret Objectives (Keep Hidden Until Scoring)

**Creature Advocate (4 points)**  
Successfully argue that Evidence B-4 proves creature exploitation. Get the group to acknowledge the ethical violations. *Revealing your unauthorized investigation might make you look like a vigilante.*

**Behavioral Expert (3 points)**  
Use Creature Sense at least twice and have both assessments proven correct by game's end. *Your illegal investigation undermines your objectivity.*

**Trafficking Exposed (2 points)**  
Identify who inside the Ministry is connected to the metamorphmagus hair trade. *Admitting you've been investigating colleagues creates suspicion.*

**WARNING:** Revealing your trafficking investigation loses you 3 points and could endanger your other sources. But if the enhanced Transmorph connection becomes clear, your knowledge might prove your innocence.

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Establish your alibi with the owls. Mention the trafficking investigation vaguely, observing reactions.

**Round 2:** Reveal the Metamorphmagus hair connection to Transmorph enhancement. Question who would need extended transformation time.

**Round 3:** Connect Bodd's questions to tonight's events. Suggest the impostor might have used enhanced potion for longer infiltration.

## Special Ability: NONE
Your expertise is in magical creatures, not investigative magic. Use your knowledge of creature-based potion ingredients to contribute to solving the mystery.

## If Targeted by Magical Detection
If Enchanter Rune uses their Magical Aura Detection on you, you MUST answer truthfully:
- **Have you cast any spells tonight?** NO (just creature observation)
- **Have you consumed any potions tonight?** NO
- **Are you currently under magical effects?** NO

You're clean! You can honestly say: "I work with creatures, not spells. My expertise is biological, not magical."

## Knowledge That Can Expose Others' Lies

Your creature expertise reveals important truths:

- **Metamorphmagus Hair Uses:** You know it's ONLY used in transformation potions, never in salves
  - *Corroborated by: Any potions textbook and Dredge (if honest)*
- **Creature Component Sources:** You know which creatures provide wand cores and potion ingredients
  - *Corroborated by: Thorn (who uses them) and supply manifests*
- **Permit Filing Locations:** Creature permits are filed in West Wing, not near Security
  - *Corroborated by: Building directory and anyone who's filed permits*
- **Owl Feeding Schedule:** Messenger owls must be fed at 7:30 PM or they become aggressive
  - *Corroborated by: Posted schedule and night shift workers*
- **Trafficking Patterns:** You know metamorphmagus hair on black market costs 500 Galleons per strand
  - *Corroborated by: Your investigation files and Evidence B4 (receipt)*

## Cover Stories When Pressed

**If asked why you were in the creature area instead of the main building:**
You can't reveal you were investigating which staff member might be trafficking.
- **The Lie:** "I was filing emergency permits near the Security office at 7:40 for tomorrow's hippogriff transport."
- **Why This Works:** Hippogriff transports require extensive paperwork. Emergency permits are common for dangerous creatures. Being near Security makes you seem less isolated.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You were actually checking if any creatures showed signs of illegal harvesting (pulled feathers, missing scales, etc.).

**If asked about your connection to the Transmorph ingredients:**
You can't admit you've been tracking metamorphmagus hair trafficking for months.
- **The Lie:** "I met with Enchanter Rune last week about ethically sourcing essence for their research. Standard creature welfare consultation."
- **Why This Works:** You do consult on ethical sourcing. Rune is known to need rare components. This explains your knowledge without implicating you.
- **The Truth You're Hiding:** You've identified that someone used Ministry resources to traffic metamorphmagus hair, and you suspect it's someone in this room.

## Revealing Your Deepest Secret

- If your trafficking investigation details are revealed publicly, you will lose points. However, revealing them may be the only credible way to clear yourself of suspicion for Bodd's murder. Choose strategically.

## Final Statement
"Even the most dangerous creature shows its true nature when cornered."
