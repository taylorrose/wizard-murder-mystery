# Magizoologist Elara Finn
*Department of Creature Relations*

## Public Background
You oversee the Ministry's magical creature affairs, from dragon incidents to house-elf rights. Your compassionate approach often puts you at odds with those who see creatures as tools or threats.

## Private Information
You were investigating illegal trafficking of Metamorphmagus hairâ€”a key ingredient in enhanced Transmorph Potion that extends transformation time. Your investigation led to someone inside the Ministry, but you haven't identified who. Bodd had asked for your expertise last week about "creature-based transformation" but you thought it was academic curiosity. You were in the creature holding area feeding the messenger owls when the body was discovered.

## Known Relationships
- **Healer Dredge:** Regular consultation on creature injuries
- **Curator Bales:** They sometimes acquire creature artifacts for display
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** Recent unusual interest in transformation
- **Wandwright Thorn:** Their wands sometimes use rare creature components

## Personal Goals
1. Share your trafficking discovery without endangering your investigation
2. Determine if enhanced Transmorph was used tonight
3. Protect innocent creatures from being blamed
4. Identify the trafficking connection inside the Ministry

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Establish your alibi with the owls. Mention the trafficking investigation vaguely, observing reactions.

**Round 2:** Reveal the Metamorphmagus hair connection to Transmorph enhancement. Question who would need extended transformation time.

**Round 3:** Connect Bodd's questions to tonight's events. Suggest the impostor might have used enhanced potion for longer infiltration.

## Optional Spell Card
**Creature Sense:** Twice per game, you may declare that you sense "predator behavior" or "prey behavior" from a player, suggesting their aggressive or defensive posture.

## Final Statement
"Even the most dangerous creature shows its true nature when cornered."
