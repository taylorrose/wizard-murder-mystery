# Minister Odran Pyke
*Acting Minister of Wonders*

## Public Background
You are the ambitious Acting Minister, appointed six months ago after the previous Minister's mysterious disappearance. You've been implementing controversial reforms to increase transparency in the Ministry's operations, making enemies among those who prefer the old secretive ways.

## Private Information
You authorized the Transmorph Potion batch that was stolen last month, signing off on it for "Auror training purposes." You fear this connection to the murder weapon could destroy your career. You also had a heated argument with Alaric Bodd last week about his research into memory modification—you suspected he was hiding something dangerous from Ministry oversight. You were in the Minister's office reviewing classified files when the body was discovered, but you can't reveal what files without compromising national security.

## Known Relationships
- **Commander Keats:** Your most trusted ally, though you worry she knows about the potion authorization
- **Inquisitor March:** Constantly questioning your reforms and authority
- **Alaric Bodd (victim):** He resisted your transparency initiatives
- **Curator Bales:** Old family friend who got their position through your recommendation

## Personal Goals
1. Maintain your position and authority
2. Keep the Transmorph authorization secret
3. Discover what Bodd was really researching
4. Identify who might be targeting Ministry leadership

## Round Prompts
**Round 1:** Establish your authority while subtly determining who had access to your office. Express concern about the lockdown but maintain calm leadership.

**Round 2:** When the Transmorph evidence surfaces, deflect from your authorization. Focus suspicion on those with potion knowledge or access to secure areas.

**Round 3:** If pressured about the authorization, claim it was a classified security measure. Push for quick resolution to maintain Ministry stability.

## Optional Spell Card
**Authority Seal:** Once per game, you may demand a direct answer to one question from one player, invoking ministerial privilege. They must answer truthfully to that specific question (they may still lie about other things).

## Final Statement
"The Ministry's very foundation rests upon trust—trust that has been shattered tonight."
